Introduction

- make sure you explicitly tell them for which countries and indicators you have reproduced the estimates:
	- only countries raw data for rural and urban
	- only the primary indicators and derived service levels:
		- basic sanitation service
		- limited sanitation service
		- unimproved sanitation service
		- no sanitation service
	- Interpolation & Extrapolation. No extension rules implemented.

- Put everything else into the outlook / next steps:
	- national estimates
	- countries with only national data
	- secondary indicators, and derived service levels
