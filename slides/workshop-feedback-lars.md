## Estimates for what?

- make sure you explicitly tell them for which countries and indicators you have reproduced the estimates:
	- only sanitation
	- only countries raw data for rural and urban
	- only the primary indicators and derived secondary service levels:
		- basic sanitation service
		- limited sanitation service
		- unimproved sanitation service
		- no sanitation service

- Put everything else into the outlook / next steps:
	- national estimates
	- countries with only national data
	- secondary indicators beyond basic sanitation services
	

## Slide: Project Outline

- Focus on the items you have under "Results". Try to show the steps you have taken. Maybe in a diagram.
	- Fit models for estimates
		- Prepare primary indicators estimates based on JMP estimation rules
			- Prepare secondary indicator service levels
	- Extract r-squared and p-values from models
		- identify those with low values < 30
			- fit alternative models


## Slide: Model fit: r-squared & Slide Model Fit: p-value

- rename x-axis (E.g. Primary Indicator)
- only display the four primary indicators (remove improved)
- consider improving the plot by using a combination of a violin plot and/or a jitter to show all data points

## Slide OLS Regression

- focus on one country at a time, show two countries is confusing
- if you want to show several examples, show each example on one slide

## Slide Plot Using a 4th Order Polynomial and following models

- Same as before, one slide per example
- In your presentation you would say "We can see that this has a better fit" -> How do I know that? Because of the displayed SE? Or do you have additional coefficients that you compared which indicate that these non-linear models are better than the linear ones?

## Add slide 

- a slide that summarises that pros and cons of these non-linear models in bullet form
- highlight the limitations of these models and refer to the 2015 report where the JMP has evaluated additional models

## Add slide

- Next steps: What is happening next for you? 
	- Submission of thesis (when?)
	- Draft of journal article (rough timeline)
