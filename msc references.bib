  abstract = {1. Tropical dry woodlands are thought to be declining as a result of human activity. Aerial photograph analysis showed measurable conversion of closed canopy miombo* to sparse woodland in Lake Malawi National Park, Malawi, from 1982 to 1990. This multi-disciplinary study investigates the possible contributions to these impacts by local use of domestic fuelwood, construction poles and fuelwood for commercial fish smoking. 2. Domestic fuelwood use was measured in 30 households over an 11-month period. Domestic fuelwood is collected by women and is headloaded to the village. It comprises a large biomass of mainly dead wood and small branches over a wide species range. Mean total annual domestic fuelwood consumption by the total enclave population was less than half the mean annual production of fallen dead wood in the Park, estimated from three quadrats harvested monthly over an 11-month period. 3. Construction poles are mostly small, have extended durability and come from a broad species range. Fencing poles frequently take root to form live hedges. Eucalyptus trees are commonly grown for poles. Construction pole use appears sustainable and shows signs of substitution. 4. The 305 commercial fish smoking stations in the enclaves used less fuelwood annually than domestic fuelwood users. However, the men who undertake this activity target large branches and logs from a narrow species range, involving destructive felling of canopy species. 95\% of men collecting fuel for fish smoking use cutting tools and three-quarters transport the wood by boat or bicycle. 5. The scale, size classes and species involved in commercial fish smoking suggest that this activity drives the observed degradation of closed canopy to sparse woodland. Traditional local fishing focused on small species sun-dried for preservation. Commercial fish smoking was introduced relatively recently by immigrants, along with gill netting that harvests larger fish requiring smoking for preservation. Demand for fish by ever-increasing urban populations underpins the continuing growth of the fish smoking industry. 6. Disaggregation of different wood use practices allows informed management policy for the Park. Currently, management targets and penalizes domestic fuelwood collectors. While seeking to reduce demand and provide alternative fuelwood sources, law enforcement and forestry extension should be reorientated to address the extraction of fuelwood for fish smoking.},

The low risk of detection and light penalties appear to favor illegal wood collection, which is practiced by the majority of women. Alternative strategies should be pursued to enhance the conservation of the woodland and its management as a fuelwood resource for local communities.},

  abstract = {This study examines the utilisation of miombo woodland by fishing communities in Lake Malawi National Park (LMNP). Combining methodologies from the natural and social sciences, patterns of use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), and the impact of harvesting practices on the resource base, are described. The main focus is the commercial and subsistence use of primary woodland resources including: fuelwood, construction materials and grass thatch. Aerial photographic analysis and a quadrat based vegetation survey are used to examine the impact of local utilisation practices on the miombo woodland. Multivariate analyses assess the importance of different environmental variables in explaining the floristic composition of the woodland vegetation. A range of NTFPs are used locally but market surveys indicate that few products are traded outside the villages. A marketing analysis suggests that urban trade is constrained by the low economic value of woodland resources compared to the high cost of rural transport. Specific patterns of collection and use are apparent for each resource. This thesis explores the impact of different harvesting practices on the miombo woodlands. Using household surveys and time allocation, the effects of children on patterns of wood collection and use are examined. The role of daughters in fuelwood collection is discussed in relation to theories of fertility and family size. Furthermore, behavioural ecology approaches are used to examine the decision making in wood collection. This research provides a useful framework for investigating resource use because it combines concurrent studies of village and woodland communities. The quantitative and rigorous approach enables the factors that influence resource use, and their impact, to be defined. This study contributes to theories of conservation and the practice of integrated management of natural resources. Furthermore, the research demonstrates the importance of woodland resources to the subsistence strategies of rural communities within a protected area system.},

  abstract = {As machine learning and data science applications grow ever more prevalent, there is an increased focus on data sharing and open data initiatives, particularly in the context of the African continent. Many argue that data sharing can support research and policy design to alleviate poverty, inequality, and derivative effects in Africa. Despite the fact that the datasets in question are often extracted from African communities, conversations around the challenges of accessing and sharing African data are too often driven by non-African stakeholders. These perspectives frequently employ a deficit narratives, often focusing on lack of education, training, and technological resources in the continent as the leading causes of friction in the data ecosystem. We argue that these narratives obfuscate and distort the full complexity of the African data sharing landscape. In particular, we use storytelling via fictional personas built from a series of interviews with African data experts to complicate dominant narratives and to provide counternarratives. Coupling these personas with research on data practices within the continent, we identify recurring barriers to data sharing as well as inequities in the distribution of data sharing benefits. In particular, we discuss issues arising from power imbalances resulting from the legacies of colonialism, ethno-centrism, and slavery, disinvestment in building trust, lack of acknowledgement of historical and present-day extractive practices, and Western-centric policies that are ill-suited to the African context. After outlining these problems, we discuss avenues for addressing them when sharing data generated in the continent.},

Among its most important principles are open methodology (comprehensive and useful documentation of methods and materials used), open access to published research output, and open data (making collected data available for re-analyses). We here present a survey conducted among members of the German Psychological Society (N~=~337), in which we applied a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative data) to assess attitudes toward OS in general and toward data sharing more specifically. Attitudes toward OS were distinguished into positive expectations (``hopes'') and negative expectations (``fears''). These were un-correlated. There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors. The analysis of the open answers revealed that generally positive attitudes toward data sharing (especially sharing of data related to a published article) are somewhat diminished by cost/benefit considerations. The results are discussed with respect to individual researchers' behavior and with respect to structural changes in the research system.},

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Public data sharing is the only topic not discussed in open science. We should make data accessible for re-analyses in a secure, reliable and competently managed repository.

\item 
Although there is a positive attitude towards open science, some researchers argue whether data sharing will benefit the careers of early career researchers.

\item 
The present study investigated the attitude towards open science and public data sharing in general, as attitudes not only contribute~to the research practice of the individual, but also the undergraduate student, the postgraduate student, the post-doctoral student, colleagues and the wider scientific community.

\item 
Method: 337 people were given scales and open-ended questions with 14 items that measured attitudes toward open science and public data sharing (e.g. what are the long-term consequences if a researcher shares raw data as part of a publication?).

\item 
Method: Attitudes toward open science were separated into hopes and fears.

\item 
Results: More hopes were related to open science and data sharing attitudes than fears.~Hopes and fears were highest for ECRs, whereas for professors, hopes and fears were the lowest.

\item 
Attitudes towards open science and public data sharing were positive but there were fears that sharing data may have negative consequences for an individual's career~(e.g. data scooping).

\item 
Professors exhibited the least hopes and fears~concerning the consequences of open science and ~data sharing.

The survey was administered to a random sample of households in metropolitan Cairo, Egypt. We apply a random parameter logit model in the analysis and illustrate the richness of information that can be obtained from this type of model by estimating individual level willingness to pay (WTP). We find a significant WTP for improved health status, both for short-run and long-run health effects. However, the estimated WTP is fairly low compared with the costs of a program that would achieve these improvements.},

  abstract = {We develop a model capturing habit formation, projection bias, and present bias in an intertemporal-choice setting, and conduct a field experiment to identify its main parameters. We elicit subjects' pre- and post-treatment predictions of post-treatment gym attendance, using a habit-formation intervention based on Charness and Gneezy (2009) as an exogenous shock to treated subjects' gym preferences. Projection-biased subjects, projecting their current habit state onto their future expectations, will, ex-ante, under-estimate any habit-formation effect of our treatment. Naive present-biased subjects in both groups will overestimate their future attendance. Like Charness and Gneezy, we find subjects do form a significant short-run habit, though we find substantial decay caused by the semester break. Subjects appear not to embed this habit formation into their ex-ante predictions. Approximately one-third of subjects formed a habit equivalent to the effect of a \$2.60 per-visit subsidy, while their predictions correspond to 90\% projection bias over this habit formation. Moreover, subjects greatly over-predict future attendance, which we interpret as evidence of partial naivet\textasciiacute e with respect to present bias: they appear to expect their future selves to be two-thirds less ``present biased'' than they currently are.},

It seeks to investigate the use of power between  doctors and patients during consultations on patient-centred approach to medicine in selected public and private  hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria. The objective is to establish how doctors' projection of power, using the discourse  resources of transitivity, affects positively or negatively their relationship with patients. This study employs  triangulation as its methodology. A judicious mix of quantitative and qualitative methods has been utilized to give the ~study a scientific shape. Proportionate stratified random sampling and purposive sampling procedures were employed.  The study employs the theoretical and analytical paradigms of Systemic Functional Linguistics and Critical Discourse  Analysis. The findings revealed that doctors predominantly use this process to the benefit of the patients. Minimal level  of intrusive and cooperative interruptions was also observed. It is expected that this study will give more visibility on  the best way patients can be empowered by lessening doctors' use of polar interrogatives and completely avoiding  interruptive discourse in clinical interactions}

  abstract = {This paper examines the dynamics of the relationships found within existing networks in informal recycling in Kaduna, Nigeria. Special attention is paid to power relations. Informal recycling is a major livelihood activity in cities in the south. Beyond the poverty perspective, the nature of informal recycling makes it an appropriate tool to use to capture the complexity and dynamism of social relations and power within networks. It consists of a variety of interrelated activities performed by different groups. The deep interconnections and interdependences necessitate the formation of networks. Drawing on empirical data, the paper reports that the networks found in Kaduna span the household, community, city, and intercity levels. The relations are informal but, in many cases, well structured. Crucially, the paper reveals that the networks are characterized by dependent relations. Those with greater access to financial and social capitals drive the system and play a greater role in shaping network rules and relations. However, no single actor or group has a monopoly on power. The interdependences mean that the different groups rely on each other, and power becomes much more diffused. Furthermore, network relations are embedded in specific sociocultural contexts. Age and gender are identified as crucial determinants in the dynamics of power and bargaining. The paper argues for a recognition of the diversity and inherent complexity of social networks and the adoption of an analytical approach that is more sensitive to the positionality and power of actors than that found in traditional ``social capitalist'' analysis.}

  abstract = {Much of the literature on gender dimensions of community-based water governance focuses on irrigation systems in rural areas. Largely overlooked is how gender dynamics influence participation in community-based urban water governance systems. To address this gap, we use insights from Feminist Political Ecology (FPE) to examine whether and how community-based governance of drinking water in an urban context leads to (in)equitable gender participation and decision making. Using household surveys (n\,=\,415), key informant interviews (n\,=\,19), focus-group discussions (n\,=\,14), we explore gender dynamics and power relations underpinning participation, decision making processes, and employment and benefit sharing arrangements among Water User Associations (WUAs) in the urban informal settlements of Lilongwe, Malawi. We find that WUAs do not guarantee equitable gender participation. Rather, inequitable participation is simply reified through: (1) gendered representation in WUA structures; (2) socio-cultural practices and women's self-exclusion; and (3) community micro-politics and power relations. Our findings contradict the notion that community-based governance of water leads to equitable participation and empowerment of women. The policy implications are that without systematic efforts to incorporate women's needs, interests, and voices, so-called participatory approaches to water governance will only serve to suppress women's agency and reinforce existing gender-based inequalities. Future work will explore the pathways to women's leadership in the WUAs and interrogate how women on the board and executive committees navigate their way up the hierarchy, their experiences in a male-dominated water governance scheme and their recommendations for how WUAs can improve women's participation.},

  abstract = {In most developing countries, the huge amount of unmanaged municipal solid wastes and the inefficiency of the current waste management system have resulted in an unprecedented detrimental effect on human health and the quality of the environment. The drive towards sustainability in solid waste management in South Africa has led to the promulgation of several legislations and policies directed towards increased efficiency of solid waste management strategies. However, despite the progress in South Africa's waste management systems over the years, it still faces several challenges and shortcomings. To achieve sustainable development through the transition from a linear economic model to a circular economy, there is a need to revamp the waste management sector. This study presents a survey of the key physical elements of integrated waste management in South Africa. The study further discusses the challenges, with a major emphasis on the future directions of integrated waste management. Waste management decisions are data-driven decisions. This study identifies the lack of accurate and reliable waste-related data as one of the major factors that impede the fast-track growth towards sustainable waste management in South Africa. A data-mining approach that emphasises intelligent modeling of waste management systems is recommended to support the national waste database, which will aid waste management decisions and optimise waste management facilities and investments. Multi-sector intervention and involvement are required to stimulate sustainable development in waste management in South Africa.},

This calls for environmentally friendly solutions, such as waste recycling and handling, to deal with the increased amount of waste, especially plastics. The plastic materials manufacturing sector is booming, particularly packaging; while only a fraction of its waste is recycled, another fraction is destroyed, and the larger part continues to pollute the environment. In addition to other waste disposal activities, destroying plastic or incineration (which could be for energy recovery) is usually subjected to strict legal requirements because of its effect on the environment. However plastic is destroyed or disposed of, it poses a serious challenge in both the short term and the long term to humans and their natural environment if the process is not efficiently managed. This article describes how a growing amount of plastic waste is disposed of haphazardly in South African townships, while most of the inhabitants are not aware or do not care about the adverse environmental and health effects of these actions. This article examines the environmental and health effects of poor plastic disposal in South African townships as it is in other developing countries to sensitise the citizens to the significance of reducing plastic waste quantities, which will downplay their impact on human health and the environment.},

  abstract = {Recycling of the municipal solid waste (MSW) was investigated and analyzed in the Indian capital city of Delhi. It was found that an informal sector comprising waste recyclists and a hierarchy of recyclable dealers plays an important role in the management of solid waste. The associated activity transports nearly 17\% of the waste to the recycling units (RU). In this process an entire market is created for the recycle trade. The present work covered an extensive study of this waste trade with emphasis on the most important unit of the waste chain, the recyclists. Extensive interviews and surveys with recyclists from various slums helped in evaluating the market mechanisms of the recycla trade in Delhi and in revealing details of this informal sector. Through a number of field interviews undertaken on recyclists, recyclables dealers and municipal authorities, a complete hierarchy from recyclists to the final sellers of the recycled product was identified and delineated and the profits at each level determined. The value addition to each product at every level of the waste trade was also determined. Two models were subsequently proposed to evaluate the possibility of formalizing the unorganized waste trade. It was concluded that it is possible to organize the sector, but this would leave more than 66,000 recyclists without employment, a consequence of organizing an activity that presently provides employment and daily living to nearly 89,600 recyclists who belong to the poorest strata of the society. The work also probes into the various aspects of the lives of the recyclists and provides details of the economics of MSW.},

Methods: In the quantitative study, a survey of IWCs was conducted at four junk shops in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul, and survey data were used to calculate age-standardized prevalence rates based on comparisons with the general population in Korea. A qualitative study was also performed to provide more details on IWCs\&rsquo; occupational and musculoskeletal injuries and depression. Results: In the quantitative study, the age-standardized prevalence rate (aSPR) of occupational injury was higher than that of the general standard population (aSPR: 10.42, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.19\&ndash;18.64) and that of blue-collar workers (aSPR: 4.65, 95\% CI 2.32\&ndash;8.32). Regarding musculoskeletal problems, compared to employed populations, the aSPRs of shoulder pain (aSPR: 2.63, 95\% CI 1.60\&ndash;4.06), wrist pain (aSPR: 3.33, 95\% CI 1.33\&ndash;6.86), knee pain (aSPR: 1.51, 95\% CI 1.01\&ndash;2.17), and ankle pain (aSPR: 3.54, 95\% CI 1.14\&ndash;8.26) were higher. Regarding psychological problems, depression (aSPR: 2.55, 95\% CI 1.27\&ndash;4.56) and suicidal or self-harm ideation (aSPR: 2.09, 95\% CI 1.11\&ndash;3.58) were higher compared to general populations. Through the qualitative study and case study on muscular problems, more details on the work environment problems of IWCs were obtained. Conclusions: IWCs are exposed to various occupational hazards and lack proper protection. They show a high prevalence of occupational injury, musculoskeletal disease, and depression.},

  abstract = {This study deals with the assessment of the role and potential contribution of\textemdash valuable and recyclable items\textemdash waste pickers (scavengers) in the overall recycling sector of solid waste management in Gaza Strip, Palestine. The analytical descriptive approach was applied in this study to achieve this goal. A special questionnaire was designed to record the views and activities of a statistically representative sample of scavengers, to determine their socio-economic conditions, their job satisfaction level, and their role in waste management. Together with that, the legal issues arising from their activity are investigated and conducted interviews with stakeholders/officials highly contributed to this. The results showed that the scavengers are mostly men, working informally for themselves, and do not belong to any official body or informal local association, yet their contribution was calculated to be 1\textendash 7.7\% as far as the recyclable diversion rate is considered. According to the processed data, 34.1\% of them are collecting from community bins distributed along the streets and from random dumpsites, 15.1\% are collecting from random dumps only, and 12.7\% are collecting from community bins distributed along the streets in addition to the random dumps and transfer stations. The monetary outcome is less than NIS 500 (New Israeli Shekels\textemdash NIS) monthly for approximately 72\% of them. Taken into consideration that 91\% of them are originating from a bad economic status, the aforementioned income\textemdash however low\textemdash is considered important for their live-hood. The results also showed that 93\% of them are dissatisfied with their job due to mainly the district of residence, the negative attitude receipt by community members, and the low selling price of recyclable materials. The analysis is a stepping stone for scavengers' incorporation to the official waste management sector, providing them orientation and on-the-job training, in addition to the government support through tax incentives to the private sector which is highly recommended in developing countries. Such activities will certainly lead further development of the recycling sector, a wide range of circular economy pattern application locally, and elevation of their financial/life status.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Small aethalometers are frequently used to measure equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass concentrations in the context of personal exposure and air pollution mapping through mobile measurements (MM). The most widely used is the microAethalometer (AE51). Its performance in the laboratory and field is well documented, however, there is not sufficient data in the context of its performance in different environments. In this investigation, we present the characterization of the performance of the AE51 through field unit-to-unit intercomparisons (IC), and against a reference absorption photometer from three MM campaigns conducted in drastically different environments. Five IC parameters were considered: i) study area, ii) location of IC, iii) time of day, iv) duration of IC, and v) correction for the filter-loading effect. We can conclude that it is crucial where and how long the IC have been performed in terms of the correlation between the mobile and reference instruments. Better correlations (R2 {$>$} 0.8, slope = 0.8) are achieved for IC performed in rural, and background areas for more than 10 minutes. In locations with more homogenous atmosphere, the correction of the loading effect improved the correlation between the mobile and reference instruments. In addition, a newer microAethalometer model (MA200) was characterized in the field under extreme cold conditions and correlated against another MA200 (R2 {$>$} 0.8, slope {$\approx$} 1.0), AE51(R2 {$>$} 0.9, slope {$\approx$} 0.9), and a stationary Aethalometer (AE33) across all wavelengths (R2 {$>$} 0.8, slope {$\approx$} 0.7). For MA200, the loading effect was more pronounced, especially at the lower wavelengths, hence the correction of the loading effect is essential to improve the correlation against the AE33. The MA200 and AE51 proved to be robust and dependable portable instruments for MM applications. Real-world quality assurance of these instruments should be performed through field IC against reference instruments with longer durations in areas of slowly changing eBC concentration.},

Different mechanical pretreatments are available for this purpose. However, data on the removal efficiencies of pretreatment systems for different types of biowaste and for different kinds of impurities are still scarce. This study aims to determine the efficiencies for impurity removal of four biowaste pretreatment plants (BTPs) at real scale \textendash{} (1) drum-screen~+~shredder~+~piston press; (2) shredder~+~piston press~+~screw press; (3) separation-mill; and (4) pulper~+~drum-screen. BTP 1 treats mixed food and garden wastes, while BTP 2, 3 and 4 treat mostly food waste. The efficiency of the pretreatment systems was influenced by the type of pretreated biowaste. The recovery of organics by the press was more efficient when pretreating food waste (BTP 2, 93\%) than for treating mixed food and garden wastes (BTP 1, 77\%). BTP 3 presented the highest recovery of biogas (up to 98\%), but also the highest transfer of inert particles to the substrate. On the contrary, BTP 4 was the most efficient for the removal of inert particles; however, this system also presented 18\% loss of biogas potential.},

  abstract = {Despite the remarkable potential for biogas production from livestock and organic wastes, the number of constructed biogas digesters for the continent is in the order of thousands and in case of Mauritania is lower than the number of the provinces. While majority of the existing digesters left far behind the expected efficiency, lack of a comprehensive economic assessment along with an efficient design questions their practical application. The present study introduced the first assessment to evaluate the biogas potential from livestock manures and waste from slaughterhouses in Northwest Africa (a case of Mauritania). Using ArcGIS\textregistered{} software, a database was conducted to build maps that show the amount of waste products, the potential of biogas, and equivalent amounts of energy. These were used to assess the potential of biogas and the corresponding potential energy for each geographical department in Mauritania. The results indicated that the southern provinces had the highest biogas potential with the maximum and the average values of 520 and 258.7 ({$\pm$}125.8)~\texttimes ~106~m3/year. On the other hand, the lowest biogas production potential (27.7~\texttimes ~106~m3/year) was recorded for northern provinces with the maximum and the average values of 135 and 76.4 ({$\pm$}39.7)~\texttimes ~106~m3/year. The results showed that 63,579~\texttimes ~106~kg of waste associated with livestock (cattle) and slaughterhouse applications were annually produced in the country. It was determined that this quantity could generate 2451~\texttimes ~106~m3 of biogas per year, corresponding to an energy potential of 52,704~\texttimes ~106~MJ/year. Considering the rapid depletion of conventional energy sources and the significance of biogas as a renewable fuel, a detailed feasibility analysis (for the biogas production in each province of Mauritania by means of community type fixed-dome digesters) was also performed in the scope of this study. The results of the comprehensive cost breakdown analysis revealed that the revenues obtained from sale of biogas-generated electricity and digested slurry (as fertilizer) could able to pay the initial investment within approximately 6.5 years without subsidy. The findings of this study, as the first of its own, could be used to comprehend how utilization of information such as slaughterhouse and livestock population, nutrition habitats, land-usage maps and geographic information system (GIS) can be employed to germinate a model for more comprehensive assessment of biogas production potential from livestock manure and slaughterhouse wastes, specifically in case of northern African countries. Moreover, in case of biogas plant, this model could be employed as a decision-making tool to identify the highly qualified location for construction of the biogas plant.},

  abstract = {Developing nations are faced with a two-edged sword in the field of energy. On the one hand the rising price of oil has reduced the potential for fossil fuel energy and eroded foreign exchange reserves in oil-importing countries. At the same time deforestation may be causing increased prices or shortages of fuels such as fuelwood and charcoal. This paper reviews the most recent and sometimes controversial estimates of deforestation in developing countries and analyzes the relationship between deforestation and its probable causes. Three recent estimates of the rate of deforestation in developing countries between 1968 and 1978 are compared using rank order correlation. Two of the estimates, of closed forest and moist tropical forest, are in significant agreement but differ from a third estimate that includes open woodland and regenerating forest. Agreement is strong among all three sources for a restricted group of countries. A cross-national analysis confirms the most frequently cited causes of deforestation. Deforestation from 1968\textendash 78 in 39 countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia is significantly related to the rate of population growth over the period and to wood fuels production and wood exports in 1968; it is indirectly related to agricultural expansion and not related to the growth of per capita GNP. Results indicate that in the short term, deforestation is due to population growth and agricultural expansion, aggravated over the long term by wood harvesting for fuel and export.},

Industrial expansion in these cities is also a major contributor to the worsening air pollution. Exposure to ambient air pollution is a major threat to human health in SSA with 176,000 deaths and 626,000 DALYs in the region attributable to ambient air pollution exposure. These estimates are however likely to be much higher than reported due to the limited data emanating from the region. Recently, the adoption of the World Health Assembly resolution on air pollution and health, and Sustainable Development Goals are a welcome boost for urban air pollution control efforts in SSA. In this article, we have outlined within the broad framework of these international policy instruments, measures for addressing urban air pollution and its associated health impacts in SSA sustainably.},

  abstract = {Sustainable development (SD) presents three pillars: environment, equality, and economy. Many scholars agree that circular economy (CE) currently displays a social gap, as most studies so far focus mostly on economic aspects and, occasionally, environmental too. Although some developed countries and especially the EU heavily promote it, there is little possibility of developing countries accepting CE unless it can fill what it is lacking. This study suggests the use of Schlosberg's tripartite environmental justice (EJ) perspective to complete the concept of CE, bringing it closer to that of SD. Due to their significant contribution to both circularity and the environment, and, likewise, due to their poor social conditions, this paper focuses on the social group of WPs, mainly in Brazil. After conducting 19 semi-structured interviews, EJ was applied to the case of the Ecopoints in Fortaleza (northeastern Brazil) and each element\textemdash recognition, distribution, and participation\textemdash detected conflicts, such as underappreciation, continuously reduced access to recyclables, distrust, and miscommunication. If CE is successful in LMCs, it will heavily rely on WPs. The analysis suggests that it is necessary to recognize their contributions in order to value their work and consequently, promote their social inclusion.}

  abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to approximately 800,000 premature deaths each year, ranking it the 13th leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, many studies show that the relationship is deeper and far more complicated than originally thought. PM is a portion of air pollution that is made up of extremely small particles and liquid droplets containing acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. PM is categorized by size and continues to be the fraction of air pollution that is most reliably associated with human disease. PM is thought to contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, direct and indirect coagulation activation, and direct translocation into systemic circulation. The data demonstrating PM's effect on the cardiovascular system are strong. Populations subjected to long-term exposure to PM have a significantly higher cardiovascular incident and mortality rate. Short-term acute exposures subtly increase the rate of cardiovascular events within days of a pollution spike. The data are not as strong for PM's effects on cerebrovascular disease, though some data and similar mechanisms suggest a lesser result with smaller amplitude. Respiratory diseases are also exacerbated by exposure to PM. PM causes respiratory morbidity and mortality by creating oxidative stress and inflammation that leads to pulmonary anatomic and physiologic remodeling. The literature shows PM causes worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent medication use, decreased lung function, recurrent health care utilization, and increased mortality. PM exposure has been shown to have a small but significant adverse effect on cardiovascular, respiratory, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease. These consistent results are shown by multiple studies with varying populations, protocols, and regions. The data demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between PM and human disease, and that removal from a PM-rich environment decreases the prevalence of these diseases. While further study is needed to elucidate the effects of composition, chemistry, and the PM effect on susceptible populations, the preponderance of data shows that PM exposure causes a small but significant increase in human morbidity and mortality. Most sources agree on certain ``common sense'' recommendations, although there are lonely limited data to support them. Indoor PM exposure can be reduced by the usage of air conditioning and particulate filters, decreasing indoor combustion for heating and cooking, and smoking cessation. Susceptible populations, such as the elderly or asthmatics, may benefit from limiting their outdoor activity during peak traffic periods or poor air quality days. These simple changes may benefit individual patients in both short-term symptomatic control and long-term cardiovascular and respiratory complications.}

Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is considered a key initiative to tackle some of these issues. To evaluate EPR role and effectiveness, 40 management scenarios focused on plastic packaging waste generated by Italian households were investigated, and their environmental performance (via a consequential life cycle assessment) and the economic sustainability of their waste value chain (via a cost-benefit analysis for each stakeholder) were compared to the recycling targets. Overall, packaging waste management represented an environmental burden. Yet, environmental benefits can be achieved by maximizing the collection rate, while minimizing the impurities collected with the source-segregated plastic and the processing losses in the recycling chain. Furthermore, the cost-benefit analysis showed that the recyclers are the weakest link in the value chain, and recycling of soft plastic and mixed polyolefin is generally not profitable. This increases the risk of exporting low-quality materials outside Europe, where their fate is uncertain. Finally, the results demonstrate that improving plastic packaging recyclability and strengthening the market for secondary plastic is critical for reaching the European recycling targets of 55\% in 2030.},

  abstract = {Background and goal The Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) sector represents a major challenge for low-and middle-income countries due to significant environmental and socioeconomic issues involving rapid urbanization, their MSWM systems, and the existence of the informal waste sector. Recognizing its role, several countries have implemented various formalization measures, aiming to address the social problems linked to this sector. However, regardless of these initiatives, not all attempts at formalization have proved successful due to the existence of barriers preventing their implementation in the long term. Along with this, there is a frequent lack of knowledge or understanding regarding these barriers and the kind of measures that may enable formalization, thereby attaining a win-win situation for all the stakeholders involved. In this context, policy- and decision-makers in the public and private sectors are frequently confronted with the dilemma of finding workable approaches to formalization, adjusted to their particular MSWM contexts. Building on the review of frequently implemented approaches to formalization, including an analysis of the barriers to and enabling measures for formalization, this paper aims to address this gap by explaining to policy- and decision-makers, and to waste managers in the private sector, certain dynamics that can be observed and that should be taken into account when designing formalization strategies that are adapted to their particular socioeconomic and political-institutional context. This includes possible links between formalization approaches and barriers, the kinds of barriers that need to be removed, and enabling measures leading to successful formalization in the long term. Method This paper involved a literature review of common approaches to formalization, which were classified into three categories: (1) informal waste workers organized in associations or cooperatives; (2) organized in CBOs or MSEs; and (3) contracted as individual workers by the formal waste sector. This was followed by the identification and subsequent classification of measures for removing common barriers to formalization into five categories: policy/legal, institutional/organizational, technical, social, and economic/financial. The approaches to formalization, as well as the barrier categories, were validated through the assessment of twenty case studies of formalization. Building on the assessment, the paper discussed possible links between formalization approaches and barriers, the `persistent' challenges that represent barriers to formalization, as well as key enabling factors improving the likelihood of successful formalization. Results Regardless of the type of approach adopted to formalization, the review identifies measures to remove barriers in all five categories, with a stronger link between the approaches 1 and 2 and the existence of measures in the policy, institutional, and financial categories. Regarding persistent barriers, the review identified ones arising from the absence of measures to address a particular issue before formalization or due to specific country- or sector-related conditions, and their interaction with the MSWM context. 75\% of the case studies had persistent barriers in respect of policy/legal issues, 50\% of institutional/organizational, 45\% of financial/economic, and 40\%, and 35\% of social and technical issues respectively. Conclusions This paper concludes that independently of the formalization approach, the lack of interventions or measures in any of the five categories of barriers may lead formalization initiatives to fail, as unaddressed barriers become `persistent' after formalization is implemented. Furthermore, `persistent barriers' may also appear due to unfavorable country-specific conditions. The success of a formalization initiative does not depend on a specific approach, but most likely on the inclusion of country-appropriate measures at the policy, economic and institutional levels. The empowerment of informal waste-workers is again confirmed as a further key success factor for their formalization.},

In the last decades, different solutions have been proposed worldwide but their sustainability has not been assessed. This paper investigates on a demonstrative scale the technical feasibility, environmental compatibility and social aspects of a recycling process of these wastes. An autoclave, coupled with a sorting machine, sterilizes the waste and separates its cellulosic and plastic fractions. The process recovers the plastics, and utilizes the cellulose in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier, to produce the steam necessary for the sterilization. The experimental tests assessed the technological feasibility of the process, and identified the operating conditions for an efficient recycling of absorbent hygiene products waste without any external energy support. The results also provide a reliable inventory of environmental burdens for a life cycle assessment of the recycling scheme and the two conventional management options of energy recovery in a municipal solid waste incinerator, and disposal in a sanitary landfill. The recycling scheme provides a strong reduction of global warming potential (-67 kgCO2equiv. vs 215 kgCO2equiv. and 130 kgCO2equiv. for incineration and landfilling, respectively), and non-renewable energy consumption (-4240 MJprimary vs -2180 MJprimary and -245 MJprimary for incineration and landfilling, respectively). Finally, the study investigated the social implications of the three alternative management options, mainly in terms of risk perception, economic advantages for the customers, and the necessary care for citizens' privacy.},

It uses metadata from existing sources and automates some tedious tasks, such as documenting psychological scales and reliabilities, summarizing descriptive statistics, and identifying patterns of missingness. The codebook R package and Web app make it possible to generate a rich codebook in a few minutes and just three clicks. Over time, its use could lead to psychological data becoming findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, thereby reducing research waste and benefiting both its users and the scientific community as a whole.},

Hence, this study was aimed at evaluating the drivers of waste generation, collection and disposal, and their impact on sustainability of Kampala as compared to the East African Community (EAC). Waste generation in Kampala was calculated using recorded waste collection efficiencies while data for Nairobi and Dar es Salaam was obtained from existing literature. Waste quantities for disposal were recorded daily at Kiteezi landfill from 2011 to 2017. Results showed that the major drivers of waste generation, collection and disposal in the EAC are population growth, vehicle capacity and the need for disposal respectively. Waste generation rate in Kampala increased from 0.26 to 0.47 kg/capita/day and the annual waste quantity increased significantly (p {$<$} 0.5) by 48\% from 227,916 to 481,081 tons corresponding to a 54\% population increase. Waste collection efficiency increased from 30\% to 64\% and hence waste for disposal increased significantly (p {$<$} 0.5), with a mean of 15,823 tons/month; but varied significantly (p {$<$} 0.5) with the city division. The most (5120 tons) and least (3472 tons) waste per month was collected from the Central and Nakawa divisions respectively. Additionally, Kampala Capital City Authority collected significantly more waste than private collectors for all study years. Waste is disposed of at the Kiteezi landfill despite exhausted capacity. Future projections showed that by 2030, annual waste would increase by approximately 60\% for Kampala and Nairobi and by 74\% for Dar es Salaam. Dar es Salaam generated the highest amount of waste, five times more than Kampala. More investment needs to be made towards the reduction of waste disposal and strategies developed for the reuse and recycling of waste.},

Waste generation rate in Allama Iqbal town is 0.80kg per capita per day. In researched area and other cities of Pakistan there is no formal sorting of waste and this activity is mainly in the hands of informal sector of which scavengers are major stakeholders. Korreywalas, Pheriwalas, waste pickers, street pickers and dumpsite pickers are different types of scavengers. Scavengers have different socio-economic and socio-demographic characteristics. Males and females of all ages, poor refugees, migrants and minorities are involved in the recovery of waste recyclables. Pheriwalas purchase recyclable items form the household and shops and all other scavengers recover the recyclable items directly from waste. All scavengers sell recyclables to junkshop dealers or contractors, which resell these to middlemen or recycling industries. Most of the recyclable materials consists of variety of paper, cardboard, metal scrap, plastics, pet bottles, dry breads, heals of shoes, bones, etc. The price of an item depends on its quality or agreement among scavengers and contractors. The earnings of scavengers depend on the recovered amounts of recyclables from the waste or purchasing from the households and the quality of recyclable items. The estimated total amount of recyclable material recovered by all the scavengers working in the area is about 525tons per month, which generate an income of US\$ 30,875 per month. They are poor, suffer harassment from officials and face health and safety problems during the work. Despite of their low economic and social status, scavengers are making important environmental and economic contributions. Scavengers not only reduce the waste but also supply secondary materials to recycling industry, save the expenditures of SWMD in sweeping, transportation and disposing of waste. The overall impact of activities of scavengers is positive economically and environmentally. Of the various categories of scavengers household waste collection system run by Korreywalas is the best. This can be improved further if government or organized private sector helps them by organizing them, providing them medical and health facilities, PPEs and financial incentives.},

Reverse logistics refers to the supply chain process of returning products from end users back through the supply chain to either the retailer or manufacturer. Whether the customer is returning items they don't need, the end of the product life cycle has been reached or the product is damaged or flawed, it's simply good business to offer returns to your customers, and that's where reverse logistics comes into play. This process also applies when items need to be either disposed of or recycled and includes the scenario where the end user is the one handling the refurbishment, disposal or even resale of the product in question.},

  abstract = {Ambient air pollution in urban cities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is an important public health problem with models and limited monitoring data indicating high concentrations of pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5). On most global air quality index maps, however, information about ambient pollution from SSA is scarce. We evaluated the feasibility and practicality of longitudinal measurements of ambient PM2.5 using low-cost air quality sensors (Purple Air-II-SD) across thirteen locations in seven countries in SSA. Devices were used to gather data over a 30-day period with the aim of assessing the efficiency of its data recovery rate and identifying challenges experienced by users in each location. The median data recovery rate was 94\% (range: 72\% to 100\%). The mean 24 h concentration measured across all sites was 38 \textmu g/m3 with the highest PM2.5 period average concentration of 91 \textmu g/m3 measured in Kampala, Uganda and lowest concentrations of 15 \textmu g/m3 measured in Faraja, The Gambia. Kampala in Uganda and Nnewi in Nigeria recorded the longest periods with concentrations {$>$}250 \textmu g/m3. Power outages, SD memory card issues, internet connectivity problems and device safety concerns were important challenges experienced when using Purple Air-II-SD sensors. Despite some operational challenges, this study demonstrated that it is reasonably practicable and feasible to establish a network of low-cost devices to provide data on local PM2.5 concentrations in SSA countries. Such data are crucially needed to raise public, societal and policymaker awareness about air pollution across SSA.},

Forecasting of MSW quantity is usually very challenging owing to unavailability of data in the low-income countries (LCs) and where data are available, they are often unreliable. The aim of this study is to forecast MSW generated in the City of Johannesburg (CoJ), South Africa with the projection period in continuing guesstimates by using machine learning approach. Two of machine learning algorithms namely: artificial neural network (ANN) and supported vector machine (SVM) were employed to forecast the quantity of MSW that would be generated in the CoJ. The forecast was based on historical data obtained from Statistics South Africa (STATS SA) and the projection was made up to 2050. The data pre-testing and incorporation structure was built in MATLAB simulation software to generate datasets having satisfactory information capacity and characteristic designed for modeling. From the result obtained, it was observed that machine learning algorithm is effective for the development of models for MSW forecasting. In the ANN models, the 10 neurons structure (ANN10) performed best with a determination coefficient (R2) of 99.9\%, while in the SVM models, the linear model performed best with R2 of 98.6\%. From the results obtained from the ANN10 model, the total amount of MSW generated per year in the City of Johannesburg is envisaged to get to 1.95~\texttimes ~106 tonnes in 2050 with an average annual waste of 1.78 x 106 tonnes.},

  abstract = {Dramatic changes to the transparency, rigor, reproducibility and replicability of research practices have occurred in the last decade. Despite considerable progress towards the adoption of open science practices by researchers in many disciplines, developing pedagogy to train students in open and reproducible scholarship has received much less attention. Engaging students with the multiple dimensions of open scholarship is crucial to embedding sustainable change: it enables the future generation of researchers to practice open scholarship themselves, fosters lasting engagement with research, and allows them to better understand findings in light of epistemic uncertainty. Teaching students about open scholarship also helps it become a public good, thereby reducing knowledge inequities in academia and beyond. We address the lack of an infrastructure for open scholarship education by introducing the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT). FORRT is a community-driven infrastructure for educators that advances research transparency, reproducibility, rigor, and ethics through pedagogical reform. FORRT encompasses multiple initiatives and tools to provide educators with guidance and resources to easily embed open and reproducible practices into research training. In addition to fostering a wider ecosystem for resource-sharing and discussion, FORRT has developed a wide range of initiatives, including a seven-part roadmap to the open scholarship literature, a curated database of open scholarship materials and pedagogies for customizable adoption by teachers, and a self-assessment tool to help educators evaluate the integration of open scholarship tenets in their own teaching and mentoring. FORRT actively works towards principled teaching and mentoring, an underappreciated dimension of the scientific endeavour.},

We justify the need to integrate open scholarship principles into research training within higher education and argue that pedagogical communities play a key role in fostering an inclusive culture of open scholarship. We illustrate these benefits by presenting A Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT), an international grassroots community whose goal is to provide support, resources, visibility, and advocacy for the adoption of principled, open teaching and mentoring practices, whilst generating conversations about the ethics and social impact of higher-education pedagogy. Representing a diverse group of early-career researchers and students across specialisms, we advocate for greater recognition of and support for pedagogical communities, and encourage all research stakeholders to engage with these communities to enable long-term, sustainable change.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of plastics production exacerbated the triple planetary crisis of habitat loss, plastic pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Circular strategies have been proposed for plastics to achieve net-zero GHG emissions. However, the implications of such circular strategies on absolute sustainability have not been examined on a planetary scale. This study links a bottom-up model covering both the production and end-of-life treatment of 90\% of global plastics to the planetary boundaries framework. Here we show that even a circular, climate-optimal plastics industry combining current recycling technologies with biomass utilization transgresses sustainability thresholds by up to four times. However, improving recycling technologies and recycling rates up to at least 75\% in combination with biomass and CO2 utilization in plastics production can lead to a scenario in which plastics comply with their assigned safe operating space in 2030. Although being the key to sustainability and in improving the unquantified effect of novel entities on the biosphere, even enhanced recycling cannot cope with the growth in plastics demand predicted until 2050. Therefore, achieving absolute sustainability of plastics requires a fundamental change in our methods of both producing and using plastics.},

  abstract = {Low-cost sensors are an opportunity to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of particulate matter data. However, such sensors should be calibrated under conditions close to the final ones before any monitoring actions. The paper presents the results of a collocated comparison of four models of low-cost optical sensors with a TEOM 1400a analyser. SDS011 (Nova Fitness), ZH03A (Winsen), PMS7003 (Plantower), and OPC-N2 (Alphasense) sensors were used in this research. Three copies of each sensor model were placed in a common box to compare the sensor performance under the same measurement conditions. Monitoring of the PM               2.5               fraction was conducted for almost half a year from 21 August 2017 to 19 February 2018 in Wroc\l aw (Poland). Reproducibility between sensor units was assessed on the basis of coefficient of variation (CV). CV values were lower than 7\% in the case of SDS011 and PMS7003 sensors and equal to 20\% for OPC-N2 units. CV was higher than 50\% for ZH03A, mainly due to malfunctions. During the measurements, the trends of outputs from sensors were generally similar to TEOM data, but significant overestimation of PM               2.5               concentrations was observed for the sensor raw data. A high linear relationship between TEOM and sensors was noticed for 1\,min, 15\,min, and 1-hour averaged data for PMS7003 sensors (                                                                        R                                                           2                                                     {$\approx$}                 0.83                              \textendash 0.89), for SDS011 units (                                                                        R                                                           2                                                     {$\approx$}                 0.79                              \textendash 0.86), and for one unit of ZH03A (                                                                        R                                                           2                                                     {$\approx$}                 0.74                              \textendash 0.81).

  abstract = {EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards is developing the one-model framework for toxics and criteria modeling for all air quality models used by U.S. EPA, including CMAQ, CAMx, REMSAD, and AERMOD. In addition, OAQPS is developing an Emission Modeling Framework (EMF) to provide better management, versioning, quality assurance, and tracking of data used for emissions modeling. The Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) modeling system is used to prepare emissions input data for many of the models used by U.S. EPA. SMOKE has been enhanced in FY05 and FY06 to better support the integration with the EMF and the one-model framework, which includes the improved integration of toxics and criteria modeling. Many updates in support of this effort have been completed, and others are currently underway or planned for the remainder of FY06 and for FY07. Updates to SMOKE v2.2 include processing data for variable grid resolutions and integration with the BlueSky fire emissions estimates model. SMOKE v2.3 significantly reduces memory requirements during gridding, can model non-sequential episodes within a single run of Temporal, supports an extended one record per line (ORL) format, and includes a new approach to wildfire inventories. Additional details regarding the usage of the new versions of SMOKE are available at www.cmascenter.org under the model documentation section. Upcoming updates to be discussed include enhancements to allow SMOKE to produce outputs for various toxics models such as ASPEN, ISCST3, and AERMOD.},

However, earth construction suffers from shrinkage cracking, low strength and lack of durability. This paper reports on the Algerian experience on earth construction in housing and gives an extended review of an experimental study to investigate a stabilised soil by either mechanical means such as compaction and vibration and/or chemical stabilisation by cement. Soil used was characterised by its grading curve and chemical composition. Compaction was either applied statically or dynamically by a drop weight method. A mixture of sand and cement was also tried. The effect of each method of stabilisation on shrinkage, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and water resistance are briefly reported. The experimental results showed that the best method of stabilisation of the soil investigated, which gives a good compressive strength and a better durability at a reasonable cost, could be a combination of a mechanical compaction and chemical stabilisation by cement or sand and cement up to a certain level.},

As such, it aims to increase the European Commission's understanding of the lack of reproducibility in Europe, and help design a suitable response in the context of EU Research \& Innovation. The report identifies the key emerging issues in reproducibility; it is informed by clearly marked expert opinion (in italics), as it emerged from the scoping seminar. Concrete recommendations of possible action by the European Commission are featured in separate `Action Boxes'. Overall the report introduces the concept of reproducibility as a continuum of practices. It is posited that the reproducibility of results has value both as a mechanism to ensure good science based on truthful claims, and as a driver of further discovery and innovation. The sections includes a working definition that is conducive for policy making and thus delimits the scope of the subject. Then the report reviews recent claims regarding the increasing lack of reproducibility in modern science, dubbed by some a `crisis of reproducibility'. It explores the main traits and underlying causes of the lack of reproducibility, including bias, poor experimental design and statistics, issues with scientific reporting, research culture, career-related factors and economics. Finally, the report reviews recent activities by scientists, research funders and publishers that aim to mitigate the lack of reproducibility; and it catalogues a range of possible remedies to the lack of reproducibility as they are found in the literature. The report provides concrete advice for policy action that may increase reproducibility in three key areas of the EU Research \& Innovation, specifically guidelines; the research grant system; and training and careers},

The findings from the descriptive case study's primary survey data indicated that the informal recycling economy in these regions has little to no barriers of entry. Initiatives to absorb individuals into this economy could potentially help decrease the unemployment level of unskilled and lowly educated people. On average, SWPs earn about R155 for a day's waste and R632 for a week's waste. The econometric results revealed that SWPs from the coloured population group who do not have access to trolleys yield statistically significantly lower earnings. Assisting SWPs through the provision of trolleys and protective gear could potentially be an advantage to sustain their income and create decent employment opportunities for SWPs.},

This paper explores the effects of two school-based management programs on parental investment in schools via voluntary contributions. One program provides both a cash grant and a matching scheme for privately raised funds. Difference-in-differences estimation shows that parents in richer schools increased voluntary contributions by 28 percent, while parents in poorer schools decreased voluntary contributions by 11 percent. This implies that a matching scheme results in higher inequality in resources available to schools. The second program provides only a cash grant to poor schools. Based on a randomized control, estimation shows that parents use 83 percent of the grant to substitute for voluntary contributions. A cash grant alone for poor schools results in an increase in resources available to the school in less than the cash grant transfer.},

Design Clustered randomised controlled study. Setting Rural Rajasthan, India. Participants 1640 children aged 1-3 at end point. Interventions 134 villages were randomised to one of three groups: a once monthly reliable immunisation camp (intervention A; 379 children from 30 villages); a once monthly reliable immunisation camp with small incentives (raw lentils and metal plates for completed immunisation; intervention B; 382 children from 30 villages), or control (no intervention, 860 children in 74 villages). Surveys were undertaken in randomly selected households at baseline and about 18 months after the interventions started (end point). Main outcome measures Proportion of children aged 1-3 at the end point who were partially or fully immunised. Results Among children aged 1-3 in the end point survey, rates of full immunisation were 39\% (148/382, 95\% confidence interval 30\% to 47\%) for intervention B villages (reliable immunisation with incentives), 18\% (68/379, 11\% to 23\%) for intervention A villages (reliable immunisation without incentives), and 6\% (50/860, 3\% to 9\%) for control villages. The relative risk of complete immunisation for intervention B versus control was 6.7 (4.5 to 8.8) and for intervention B versus intervention A was 2.2 (1.5 to 2.8). Children in areas neighbouring intervention B villages were also more likely to be fully immunised than those from areas neighbouring intervention A villages (1.9, 1.1 to 2.8). The average cost per immunisation was \$28 (1102 rupees, about \textsterling 16 or \texteuro 19) in intervention A and \$56 (2202 rupees) in intervention B. Conclusions Improving reliability of services improves immunisation rates, but the effect remains modest. Small incentives have large positive impacts on the uptake of immunisation services in resource poor areas and are more cost effective than purely improving supply.},

  abstract = {Abstract Biogas could provide a more sustainable energy source than wood fuels for rural households in sub-Saharan African. However, functioning of biogas digesters can be limited in areas of low water availability. The water required is approximately 50~dm3~day?1 for each cow and 10~dm3~day?1 for each pig providing manure to the digester, or 25 ({$\pm$}6)~dm3~day?1 for each person in the household, using a digester volume of 1.3 ({$\pm$}0.3)~m3 capita?1. Here, we consider the potential of domestic water recycling, rainwater harvesting, and aquaculture to supply the water needed for digestion in different countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Domestic water recycling was found to be important in every country but was usually insufficient to meet the requirements of the digester, with households in 72\% of countries need to collect additional water. Rooftop rainwater harvesting also has an important role, iron roofs being more effective than thatched roofs at collecting water. However, even with an iron roof, the size of roof commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa (15 to 40~m2) is too small to collect sufficient water, requiring an extra area (in m2) for each person of (R/100) (where R is the rainfall in mm). If there is a local market for fish, stocking a pond with tilapia, fed on plankton growing on bioslurry from the digester, could provide an important source of additional income and hold the water required by the digester. In areas where rainfall is low and seasonal, the fishpond might be stocked only in the rainy season, allowing the pond to be covered during the dry period to reduce evaporation. If evaporative losses (E in mm) exceed rainfall, an extra catchment area is needed to maintain the water level in the pond, equivalent to approximately (1.5~?~((E?R)/R))~m2 for each person in the household.},

  abstract = {Access to ?formal? electricity networks remains a key challenge in many African urban areas. Significant attention has been paid to how access to an electricity connection should be provided, with much less attention paid to how electricity infrastructures are operated and maintained. Attention to how utilities govern the challenges inherent to ?informality? in the production of ?formal? networked infrastructure is less common, especially in African cities. Moreover, with a few notable exceptions, studies on infrastructure maintenance and repair treat ?informality? as a subtext to broader examinations of the uneven urban landscapes produced through infrastructure and its mediating technologies. Drawing on a socio-technical approach to electricity infrastructures, this article explores how utilities engage with ?informality? to produce access to ?formal? electricity networks through everyday processes of maintenance and repair. To this end, the article uses the empirical case of Mozambique?s national electricity company, EDM (Electricidade de Mo\c{c}ambique, E.P.) and its transition to an electricity network mediated by prepayment technologies in the capital city Maputo. The article argues that a socio-technical approach to infrastructures provides key insights into how utilities implicate the spatial and socio-economic dimensions of ?informality? in the design, delivery, and maintenance and repair of ?formal? electricity networks. Utilities do so through pragmatic, situated practices that sustain and continually produce and reproduce infrastructures in cities. This highlights how infrastructures are always precarious achievements and service delivery is always a process in the making. The article is based on deskwork, archival work, and fieldwork conducted by the author in Maputo since 2013.},

Despite this, national and subnational energy policies often neglect biomass cooking fuels. A Formative Scenario Analysis process is applied to show how the cooking fuel sector in Kilimanjaro Region (Tanzania) and Kitui County (Kenya) might evolve by 2030. In order to provide relevant knowledge for potential energy policies, this paper aims to identify the main drivers impacting the cooking fuel sector, and to assess and explore current and future demand and supply potential of biomass cooking fuels. Our results show that policies have the potential to substantially impact the future mix of cooking fuels and to foster or hamper the use of efficient cooking fuel technologies. Half of Kilimanjaro Region's households could be supplied with biogas; in Kitui County, wood-based cooking fuels is likely to remain dominant but improving the efficiency of the technologies would reduce the demand for wood considerably. Hence, we argue that energy policies should explicitly consider biomass cooking fuels and endeavour to make this sector more sustainable and that priority should be given to increasing the sustainability of the biomass cooking fuel sector. Key leverage points to do so are improving the access to improved biomass technologies and capacity building.},

This is surprising given the key role that hospitals play in the delivery of healthcare services and the large proportion of health systems resources that they absorb. To explore the factors that impact upon priority setting at the hospital level, we conducted a thematic review of empirical studies. A systematic search of PubMed, EBSCOHOST, Econlit databases and Google scholar was supplemented by a search of key websites and a manual search of relevant papers' reference lists. A total of 24 papers were identified from developed and developing countries. We applied a policy analysis framework to examine and synthesize the findings of the selected papers. Findings suggest that priority setting practice in hospitals was influenced by (1) contextual factors such as decision space, resource availability, financing arrangements, availability and use of information, organizational culture and leadership, (2) priority setting processes that depend on the type of priority setting activity, (3) content factors such as priority setting criteria and (4) actors, their interests and power relations. We observe that there is need for studies to examine these issues and the interplay between them in greater depth and propose a conceptual framework that might be useful in examining priority setting practices in hospitals.}

  abstract = {Nearly 40\% of the world's population still relies on biomass stoves as their primary cooking source. Indoor cooking with biomass stoves produces harmful emissions such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and can result in significant cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Air injection technology, in the forms of over-fire, under-fire, and staged (a combination of under- and over-fire), has been used for decades to reduce emissions in small-scale industrial biomass burners. Recently, researchers have begun integrating air-injection into biomass cookstoves, but the number of studies is limited, and improper air-injection can result in worsening stove performance. In this paper, we develop and analyze three wood-burning biomass rocket stove air-injection strategies using computational fluid dynamics and experiments. We consider over-fire and under-fire air-injection independently, and then develop a staged air-injection system that combines the optimal jet characteristics from the purely over-fire and under-fire systems. Results show that significant performance gains, both in terms of reduced emissions and increased burn-rate are achievable with forced air-injection. For a radial over-fire air injection system, jet momentum flux is found to control fuel and air mixing and is the driving metric for reducing particulate emissions. For the under-fire system, excess air ratio was found to control both the emissions rate and firepower. In a comparison of all three air-injection strategies, over-fire air injection was found to have the largest reduction in emissions, under-fire air injection had the largest increase in firepower and reduction in boiling times, and the staged air injection method achieved both improved emissions and burn-rate. Additionally, the combustion start-up phase was observed to account for the majority of emissions in all forced-draft stoves, and is most sensitive to under-fire injection, remaining an area ripe for improvement.},

It was developed from an Expert workshop of 32 scientists convened by the World Health Organization and the WHO/NSF International Collaborating Centre for Drinking Water Safety and Treatment in Geneva, Switzerland. Heterotrophs are organisms, including bacteria, yeasts and moulds, that require an external source of organic carbon for growth. The HPC test (or Standard Plate Count), applied in many variants, is the internationally accepted test for measuring the hetrotrophic microorganism population in drinking water, and also other media. It measures only a fraction of the microorganisms actually present and does not distinguish between pathogens and non-pathogens. High levels of microbial growth can affect the taste and odor of drinking water and may indicate the presence of nutrients and biofilms which could harbor pathogens, as well as the possibility that some event has interfered with the normal production of the drinking water. HPC counts also routinely increase in water that has been treated by an in-line device such as a carbon filter or softener, in water-dispensing devices and in bottled waters and indeed in all water that has suitable nutrients, does not have a residual disinfectant, and is kept under sufficient conditions. There is debate among health professionals as to the need, utility or quantitative basis for health-based standards or guidelines relating to HPC-measured regrowth in drinking water. The issues that were addressed in this work include: the relationship between HPC in drinking water (including that derived from in-line treatment systems, dispensers and bottled water) and health risks for the general public the role of HPC as an indirect indicator or index for pathogens of concern in drinking water the role of HPC in assessing the efficacy and proper functioning of water treatment and supply processes the relationship between HPC and the aesthetic acceptability of drinking water. Heterotrophic Plate Counts and Drinking-water Safety provides valuable information on the utility and the limitations of HPC data in the management and operation of piped water systems as well as other means of providing drinking water to the public. It is of particular value to piped public water suppliers and bottled water suppliers, manufacturers and users of water treatment and transmission equipment and inline treatment devices, water engineers, sanitary and clinical microbiologists, and national and local public health officials and regulators of drinking water quality.},

  abstract = {Packaging represents the largest fraction of plastic waste in Europe. Currently, mechanical recycling schemes are mainly focused on the recovery of rigid packaging (like bottles), while for flexible packaging, also called films, recycling rates remain very low. Existing mechanical recycling technologies for these films are quite basic, especially in the case of complicated post-consumer flexible plastics (PCFP) waste, leading to regranulate qualities that are often subpar for renewed use in demanding film applications. In this study, the technical and economic value of an improved mechanical recycling process (additional sorting, hot washing, and improved extrusion) of PCFPs is investigated. The quality of the four types of resulting regranulates is evaluated for film and injection molding applications. The obtained Polyethylene-rich regranulates in blown films offer more flexibility (45\textendash 60\%), higher ductility (27\textendash 55\%), and enhanced tensile strength (5\textendash 51\%), compared to the conventional mechanical recycling process. Likewise, for injection molded samples, they exhibit more flexibility (19\textendash 49\%), enhanced ductility (7 to 20 times), and higher impact strength (1.8 to 3.8 times). An economic assessment is made between the obtained increased market value and the capital investment required. It is shown that the economic value can be increased by 5\textendash 38\% through this improved recycling process. Overall, the study shows that it is possible to increase the mechanical recycling quality of PCFP in an economically viable way, thus opening the way for new application routes and overall increased recycling rates.},

It starts with a systematic examination of the main types of alliances formed around SWM activities (including formal collection, transportation and disposal as well as informal collection, trade, re-use and recycling). These include public\textendash private, public\textendash community, community\textendash private and private\textendash private alliances. The main conclusion is that local authorities work together with large enterprises and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but refuse to deal directly with the informal trade and recycling enterprises which recover large fractions of waste \textendash{} linking to them only through NGO or community-based organisation (CBO) mediation. It goes on to examine the contributions different alliances can make to sustainable development in cities, utilising the multiple goals of sustainable development as developed by Satterthwaite in 1997 (Urban Studies 34 (1997) 1667). Using a nine-point indicator system, it shows that current contributions of alliances between local authorities and large enterprises lie mainly in the area of improved disposal, cleaner neighbourhoods and financial viability. In contrast, alliances between local authorities, NGOs or CBOs and through them informal trade and recycling enterprises contribute more heavily to financial viability, employment, and cleaner urban neighbourhoods, as well as greater re-use and recycling of waste fractions.},

R Markdown is a new technology that makes creating fully-reproducible statistical analysis simple and painless. It provides a solution suitable not only for cutting edge research, but also for use in an introductory statistics course. We present evidence that R Markdown can be used effectively in introductory statistics courses, and discuss its role in the rapidly-changing world of statistical computation.},

\par
A version control system records changes to a file or a set of files over time so that changes can be tracked and specific versions of a vile can be recalled later.
\par
Well-documented and reproducible data wrangling skills as a necessary component of the undergraduate statistics curriculum.
\par
Version control is the foundation for reproducible workflows.
\par
Motivations for identifying version control as a learning objective
\par
1st Motivation: Reproducibility
\par
For a scientific study to be replicated, the statistical analysis in this study must be entirely reproducible.Raise students awareness if scientific reproducibility and equip them with the knowledge and skills to conduct their future data analyses reproducibly. That counts for both the academic research project or in industry.
\par
[[Permanent Notes]] Our course provides the competitive advantage of having the knowledge and skills to conduct data analyses reproducibly. Being able to show these skills will provide you with a greater chance to succeed in an analytical career.
\par
Literate programming helps a long way with reproducibility, but it is unlikely that an analysis will be captured in one script only. Data analysis is an iterative process that produces many byproducts.
\par
[[Permanent Notes]] Managing a the iterative data analysis process with byproducts is not unique to statistics but is something that curricula are slow to address.
\par
2nd Motivation: Industry and academic preparedness (public sector preparedness?)
\par
Ability to use version control systems is a highly desired skill in any industry, but also the public sector.
\par
Knowing how to usew GitHub is an essential skill in the tech field, just as important as software development and technical writing (Zagalsky, 2015).
\par
We are living in an era where many of us are and will be working alongside software engineers and developers, it is essential to equip us with these skills.
\par
Early and regular exposure to version control in a curriculum ensures that students develop workflows for conducting analyses individually and collaboratively.
\par
As students periodically submit their assignments as they work on it, there is less pressure of the final deadline where everything must be submitted in its final form.
\par
Experience from different courses: First Year Data Computing Course (Beckman)
\par
MCQ: Does a pull action modify files in (a) the directory on your local computer [correct answer], (b) on the GitHub Remote Server, (c) both, (d) neither.
\par
All work in RStudio. Terminal used for Git configuration step. Using GitHub Pro Organization through GitHub Education. First Expourse all happens on GitHub with them adding their username to a table.
\par
Experience from different courses: A Second Course in Statistics (Tackett)
\par
Using [[\{ghclass\}]] R Package
\par
knit-commit-push as a mantra and cues for students commit-pull-push as another set of cues and to rotate which team member types responses.
\par
Examples of informative commit messages
\par
Reminder to review work in the assignment repo
\par
Need to ensure that grades are securely stored within the universities LMS (Moodle, eDoz?)
\par
Recommendations:
\par
(1) Get buy-in early. Students need to understand the value and how these computing skills are used early.
\par
(2) Focus only on GitHub functionality
\par
(3) Use the Git pane
\par
Experience from different courses: A Master's Level Statistical Programming Course (Rundel)
\par
This is valuable to address the all- too-common situation that a distributed assignment includes a typo, a minor issue with the data, or the repo contains the wrong version of a file. [[\{\vphantom\}ghclass\vphantom\{\}]] Package allows to push corrected files out to all students repos in a way that is merged with any existing work.
\par
Class includes at least one 1 hr of lecture in the first week to motivate the topics of using Git and GitHub. Brief introduction to the history and then live demonstration of the tools. \textbf{}
\par
As part of the live demonstration, the instructor leads students through this process and how to locate and interact with the repository on GitHub. This leads to forking the repository, cloning the Git repository as an RStudio project, and a demo of the basic use of the Git pane. The basic Git actions such as stage, commit, push, and pull are covered and the class usually concludes by purposefully inducing a merge conflict to demonstrate the process of resolving it. 
\par
Worflow
\par
RStudio Project with README (description of assignment), scaffolded R Markdown for a uniform structure and clear indiciations where students should enter their implementations/solutions and writeup.
\par
Assessment
\par
Frustration to have back and forth between lecturer and students. Automatic feedback was introduced on the basic processes of their assignment. CI Tools using GitHub Actions. \href{https://github.com/rundel/ghclass-actions}{https://github.com/rundel/ghclass-actions} [[GitHub Actions]]
\par
There have not been any specific efforts to encourage particular workflows with Git/GitHub (i.e., branch- ing, issues, etc.) 
\par

\par
\href{https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github}{https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github}
\par
Workflow
\par
The class consists of a 15 minute overview and review of pre-class work. Then students begin a project by cloning their assigned project in RStudio. Each class they first commit their pre- class work into the team repository. They then review and comment on each others code and push those comments and feedback. At this point, they begin working on team coding projects. They typically create their own scrap work file and then together decided on which code is displayed on the teams' final results. 
\par
Assessment
\par
Scoring rubrics include evaluation of the repository history and commit messages as well as R programming style. 
\par
Recommendations
\par
Experiment with Git and RStudio implemented on various computers. 
\par
Invest some time early to motivate the workflow with Git and address common pitfalls. For example, students should avoid committing files that they did not actually change to help minimize merge conflicts, and instead investigate why they show up in the Git pane in the first place. 
\par
Each student working in shared repositories could be encouraged to main- tain an individual scrap work file in the repository that only they edit as a measure to avoid merge conflicts or overwriting someone else's work. 
\par
Discussion
\par
Students Need to See Value of These Expert-Friendly Tools
\par
How can we help to motivate students to think about the importance of workflow and develop internal motivation? 
\par
We saw multiple examples of instructor scaffolding to pro- vide a guided introduction to the power and value of GitHub (to track and document their work) without getting lost in the details. We believe that the scaffolded introduction to GitHub is a useful if not sufficient framework to build more habits that foster reproducibility.
\par
Start Slowly and Keep It Simple
\par
Having students learn to use straightforward Git workflows early on is a big step on their path to developing good habits for workflow and collaboration. 
\par
Why GitHub (and Not GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)?
\par
\textbf{For GitHub API, GitHub Actions,~}
\par
This is especially important for institutions outside of the United States since there may be laws around student data leaving the country and being stored on US servers, for example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
\par
One remedy to this is for the university to enter a data pro- tection agreement with GitHub for GDPR compliance. 
\par
The company currently seems dedicated to continue offering free private organizations and repositories for educa- tional use, and we have no reason to doubt this. 
\par
Not One Single Path
\par
There are also various approaches to assessing student work and providing feedback on GitHub. Use of issues to provide feedback is a popular approach, and it is possible to make this process more efficient and streamlined with the use of issue tem- plates. 
\par
Peer Review
\par
Peer review gives students the opportunity to meaning- fully engage with each others' work and learn from each other. It also gives them a chance to try to reproduce others' work and experience the difficulties of reproducing others' work. 
\par
Possible with the [[\{ghclass\}]] Package
\par
Creating Portfolios
\par
Use GitHub Profile as part of their job search.
\par
One approach is to only allow students to convert their final project repository to be public, and let them know of specific assignments from class that are approved for reproducing in public repositorie. Moreover, it is important for instructors to keep summative or overly critical feedback and any grades out of repositories that students might convert to public repositories later. Any team work also needs to be handled with care: all team members need to agree that work can be made public. 
\par
Assessment
\par
We recommend making use of peer evaluations in any courses that involve teamwork to get a clearer picture of each student's contribution, and supplementing the feedback from these evaluations with commit history statistics 
\par
It is crucial for instructors to model good version control hygiene before assessing it, as students cannot be expected to come into the class with an intuition for what is reasonable commit content or message. 
\par
Automation and Workflow
\par
or the instructor, this might facil- itate auto-pulling local files, simplify returning feedback to stu- dents (e.g., a script to open all repositories to the issues page, a script to pull files, add a file called feedback.md that includes comments, commit, and push to many repos). The use of continuous integration tools to check for compilation may be particularly helpful as students work on more complex tools and approaches that go beyond the capabilities of their laptops. 
\par
This is an area where new approaches are being developed in the research community that have the potential to improve student experiences and/or simplify work by the instructor and improve learning outcomes for students. 
\par
Closing Thoughts
\par
Students heading into the workforce need to be able to structure, organize, and communicate their wor. 
\par
However, they often find collaboration, and especially merge conflicts, more challenging. To help ease this challenge students may get together in person for team projects so that they can make commits from a single computer, which can also be seen as a positive outcome, but it shows that students find collaborating on GitHub challenging
\par
None of the classes mentioned in this article have systematically collected data on student attitudes toward version control. We believe that this would be a valuable next step for statistics and data science courses so that we can explore how the implemen- tation of GitHub in the classroom is associated with students' classroom experiences, similar to Hsing and Gennarelli (2019), which discusses such a study conducted on students in com- puter science courses. Such assessment data and other findings informed by the learning sciences would help improve instruc- tion in this area. Future research could help inform a publication akin to Hesterberg's (2015) guide to teaching resampling enti- tled ``What every statistics and data science instructor should know about version control and reproducible workflows.''},

  abstract = {While numerous studies have demonstrated that shortterm exposure to particulate matter (PM*) is associated with adverse health effects, the characteristics of PM that cause harm are not well understood, and PM toxicity may vary by its chemical composition. This study investigates whether spatial and temporal patterns in PM health effect estimates based on total mass can be explained by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the chemical composition of the particles. A database of 52 chemical components of PM with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; or = 2.5 pm (PM2.5) was constructed for 187 U.S. counties, for 2000 through 2005, based on data from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) monitoring networks. Components that covary with PM2.5 total mass and/or are large contributors to PM2.5, total mass were identified using actual and seasonally detrended data. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, seasonal and temporal variation in PM2.5 and the risk of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory hospital admissions were investigated for persons \&gt; or = 65 years in 202 U.S. counties for 1999 through 2005. Seasonal variation was investigated using three model structures with different underlying assumptions about the relationship between PM2.5 and hospitalizations. The findings of this study indicate higher effects in winter for both causes of hospitalization, and higher effects in the Northeast for cardiovascular admissions, although 53\% of the counties were in this region. Higher PM2.5 effect estimates for cardiovascular or respiratory hospitalizations were observed in seasons and counties with a higher PM2.5 content of nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), or EC. Mortality effect estimates for PM with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; or = 10 pm (PM10) were higher in seasons and counties with higher PM2.5 Ni content. The association between the Ni content of PM2.5 and effect estimates for cardiovascular hospitalization was robust to adjustment by EC, V, or both EC and V. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in the fraction of PM2.5 that is Ni was associated with a 14.9\% (PI, 3.4-26.4) increase in the relative rates of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with PM2.5 total mass adjusted for EC and V. No associations were observed between PM total mass health effect estimates and community-level variables for socioeconomic status, racial composition, or urbanicity. Communities with a higher prevalence of central AC had lower PM2.5 effect estimates for cardiovascular hospital admissions. The findings of this study indicate strong spatial and temporal variation in the chemical composition of the particle mixture and in the regional and seasonal variation in health effect estimates for PM2.5 total mass. The chemical composition of particles partially explained the heterogeneity of effect estimates. Observed associations could be related to the components themselves, to other components, or to a combination of components that share similar sources. The findings do not exclude the possibility that other components or characteristics of PM are harmful. The limitations of this study include the use of community-level aggregated data for exposure and for the variables used to investigate alternate hypotheses. Also, particle components and chemical forms (e.g., ammonium sulfate) not measured in the U.S. EPA database were not included. PM10 results in particular should be viewed with caution as the time frame of measurement and PM size fraction are different for the chemical composition and health effects data. A better understanding of the particular chemical components or sources that are most harmful to health can help decision-makers develop more targeted air pollution regulations and can aid in understanding the biological mechanisms by which air pollution-related health effects occur, thereby informing future research.},

  abstract = {Mismanaged plastic waste is a major environmental concern, especially in countries of the Global South. Municipal solid waste management can not only alleviate environmental problems but also create jobs and promote local economic growth. However, providing appropriate waste management services is costly. The question is to what extent waste management policies that have proven to be successful in other geographies can help solve the challenge in developing countries. Specifically, the economics and financial flows along the value chain need to be known. In this paper, we shed light on these questions by presenting a novel, model-based method to elicit and assess the cost structure of the recycling sector in developing countries. We exemplify our method with plastics waste management in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana\textemdash an area particularly challenged by plastic waste. For this purpose, we surveyed over 80 participants of the waste management value chain and combined the data with insights from expert interviews and workshops. Based on this data, we built a bottom-up model with 67 parameters, reflecting all cost positions in the waste management value chain. We found that street waste pickers are the poorest and most vulnerable, earning only a fraction of the already low minimum wage. Middlemen and aggregators, while often being criticized for their earnings, also provide social-security-like services to waste pickers. In addition, formal and informal recyclers differ not only in earnings and size but also in recyclate quality where the informal sector provides higher quality.},

  abstract = {The threat of plastic waste pollution in African countries is increasing exponentially since the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus infection as a pandemic. Fundamental to this growing threat are multiple factors, including the increased public consumption for single-use plastics, limited or non-existence of adequate plastic waste management infrastructures, and urbanisation. Plastics-based personal protective equipment including millions of surgical masks, medical gowns, face shields, safety glasses, protective aprons, sanitiser containers, plastics shoes, and gloves have been widely used for the reduction of exposure risk to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This paper estimates and elucidates the growing plethora of plastic wastes in African countries in the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral fingerprint indicates that face masks were characterised by natural and artificial fibres including polyester fibres, polypropylene, natural latex resin. Our estimate suggests that over 12 billion medical and fabric face masks are discarded monthly, giving the likelihood that an equivalent of about 105,000 tonnes of face masks per month could be disposed into the environment by Africans. In general, 15 out of 57 African countries are significant plastic waste contributors with Nigeria (15\%), Ethiopia (8.6\%), Egypt (7.6\%), DR Congo (6.7\%), Tanzania (4.5\%), and South Africa (4.4\%) topping the list. Therefore, this expert insight is an attempt to draw the attention of governments, healthcare agencies, and the public to the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2-generated plastics (COVID plastic wastes), and the environmental impacts that could exacerbate the existing plastic pollution epidemic after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging accounted for 44.7\% of single-serve beverage packaging in the US in 2021, and 12\% of global solid waste. A strategic solution is needed to manage plastic packaging solid waste. Major beverage manufacturers have pledged to reduce their environmental footprint by taking steps towards a sustainable future. The PET bottle has several properties that make it an environmentally friendly choice. The PET bottle has good barrier properties as its single-layer, mono-material composition allows it to be more easily recycled. Compared to glass, the PET bottle is lightweight and has a lower carbon footprint in production and transportation. With modern advancements to decontamination processes in the recycling of post-consumer recycled PET (rPET or PCR), it has become a safe material for reuse as beverage packaging. It has been 30 years since the FDA first began certifying PCR PET production processes as compliant for production of food contact PCR PET, for application within the United States. This article provides an overview of PET bottle-to-bottle recycling and guidance for beverage manufacturers looking to advance goals for sustainability.},

\par
Mechanical recycling is a conventional recycling method. After plastic containers are sorted and separated from associated contaminants, washed, and dried, they are ground (flaked), melted, and reprocessed into plastic pellets by extrusion. This process does not change the chemical nature of the polymeric material. Physical recycling does, however, impact the molecular weight of the recycled PET [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/14/12/2366/htm#B31-polymers-14-02366}{31}}]. PET is a hydrophilic polymer and will attract moisture. Under high-temperature conditions (e.g., melt extrusion), reaction with water results in hydrolytic degradation (hydrolysis) and the reduction of average molecular weight (MW). Molecular weight reduction affects mechanical properties, melt viscosity, and impact resistance of the polymeric material [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/14/12/2366/htm#B32-polymers-14-02366}{32}}]. To mitigate this issue, the PCR manufacturers usually increase the molecular weight of the PET by solid-state polymerization (SSP), where the polymer is heated below its melting point but above the glass transition temperature to remove the condensate byproducts, yielding a polymer with higher molecular weight. This process improves intrinsic viscosity (IV) and eliminates volatile organic compounds (VOC). Following SSP, recycled PET can be analyzed for benzene and limonene content. Benzene is a byproduct of PVC contamination and degradation. Limonene is a flavoring agent primarily carried over from residual citrus juices and may potentially impact the organoleptic properties of the packaged beverage [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/14/12/2366/htm#B28-polymers-14-02366}{28}}]. Quantification of these components is indicative of the VOC removal effectiveness of the SSP, which in turn is indicative of a PCR being suitable for food contact application. Mechanical recycling of PET has been widely adopted in several countries~},

Using a representative online and telephone survey of California households, we estimate a discrete choice model that identifies the key attributes explaining consumers' beverage container disposal decisions: the refund amount (paid to consumers only if they recycle at drop-off centers), the volume of recyclable material generated by the household, and the effort associated with bringing recyclable materials to recycling centers. Additionally, we use counterfactual policy analy- sis to show that increasing the refund amount increases overall recycling rates, with the largest changes in consumer surplus accruing to inframarginal consumers, who are on the boundary between taking containers to recycling centers and recycling using curbside pick-up, namely white and higher income consumers. Conversely, we show that eliminating government-subsidized drop-off centers does not significantly alter consumer surplus for any major demographic group, and has little impact on recycling rates.},

It is well known that informal collection contributes to the recycling of resources in a positive way, but it is also associated with several environmental, health, and social problems. In Colombia, these recyclers work informally. In 2016, Decree 596 was issued, which regulates the utilization of the public cleaning service and the transitory regime for the formalization of informal recyclers. The objective of this work is to evaluate the social and technical impact of recycling in the city of Bogot\&aacute; three years after the regulations were issued. A study was carried out in order to study how recyclers have been affected by the new regulations after three years of validity as well as understand their perceptions of the evolution of recycling in the city. The study consisted of a series of surveys of recyclers from a statistical sample with 0.05 error that applied a mixed approach. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were included. This analysis was done in order to mix statistical results with deep analysis. The survey indicated that a low percentage of users (good 28\%) performed good processes of separation at the source, which lowers the recovery of materials and prevents the potential use of many others. Likewise, it was evidenced that for a material to be sold or commercialized it depends significantly on the separation at the source. In addition, according to the perception of the respondents, society tends to discriminate against them, which leads to the conclusion that discrimination still exists between both the government and society. Finally, the current legislation has not been effective in its implementation and court declarations regarding recyclers as people with inherent rights have not yet been applied in Colombia.},

  abstract = {There have been few detailed assessments of the actual impacts of improved stove interventions in rural communities, although many improved stove projects have reported overall efficiencies from tests in simulated kitchens using water-boiling tests (WBTs). This paper presents an integrated energy evaluation of the Patsari cookstove, an efficient wood-burning cookstove developed in Mexico that has recently obtained international recognition, in comparison to traditional cookstoves in rural communities of Michoacan, Mexico. The evaluation uses three standard protocols: the WBT, which quantifies thermal efficiency and firepower; the controlled cooking test (CCT), which measures specific energy consumption associated with local cooking tasks, and the kitchen performance test (KPT), which evaluates the behavior of the stoves in-field conditions and estimates fuel savings. The results showed that the WBT gave little indication of the overall performance of the stove in rural communities. Field testing in rural communities is of critical importance, therefore, in estimating the benefits of improved stoves. In the CCT for tortilla making, the main cooking task in Mexican rural households, Patsari stoves showed fuelwood savings ranging from 44\% to 65\% in relation to traditional open fires (n=6; P{$<$}0.05). These savings were similar in magnitude to the average energy savings from KPT before and after Patsari adoption of 67\% (n=23; P{$<$}0.05) in rural households exclusively using fuelwood. Similar energy savings of 66\% for fuelwood and 64\% for LPG, respectively, were also observed in households using mixed fuels. With sound technical design, critical input from local users and proper dissemination strategies, therefore, improved stoves can significantly contribute to improvements in the quality of life of rural people with potential benefits to the surrounding environment.},

The conventional fired clay bricks and concrete masonry still play vital roles in the construction industry. However, the use of virgin materials and carbon emissions associated with their production have raised questions about their environmental sustainability. This study investigates the potential of using dredged material from a confined disposal facility (CDF) in Cleveland, Ohio, to fabricate eco-friendly bricks. The brick samples were made using mixtures of sand, sieved from the dredged material, with 8\%, 10\%, and 12\%, by weight, of Type I/II cement, and compacting the samples using a pressure of 2~MPa or 4~MPa. The compressive strength, water absorption, and freeze\textendash thaw resistance of the bricks were evaluated in the laboratory per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method C67. The compressive strength of the bricks ranged from 10.3~MPa to 17.2~MPa, whereas absorption ranged from 13\% to 18\%. The 50-cycle freeze\textendash thaw (F-T) weight loss ranged from 0.1\% to 0.4\%, demonstrating that durable bricks, meeting the ASTM specifications (0.5\% maximum F-T weight loss after 50 cycles), could be produced using the dredged material. Furthermore, a life cycle inventory of dredged material\textendash cement brick (DM-CB) was established to compare its environmental impacts with conventional fired clay brick, concrete masonry units, and compressed stabilized brick. The DM-CB was observed to have the least embodied energy of 1.49~MJ/kg and an embodied greenhouse gas emission of 0.162~kg CO2e/kg, making it the eco-friendliest and environmentally sustainable product compared to conventional bricks.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to assist policy makers in formulating efficient and sustainable wetland management policies in accordance with the Ramsar Convention and the European Union Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), by providing results of a valuation study on the Cheimaditida wetland in Greece. A choice experiment is employed to estimate the values of changes in several ecological, social and economic functions that Cheimaditida wetland provides to the Greek public. In addition to the conditional logit model, a random parameter logit model, a random parameter logit model with interactions and a latent class model are estimated to account for heterogeneity in the preferences of the public for the various functions of the wetland. The results reveal that there is considerable preference heterogeneity across the public and on average they derive positive and significant values from sustainable management of this wetland. The estimated economic benefits of sustainable wetland management are weighed against the costs of alternative wetland management scenarios. Results of this cost\textendash benefit analysis can aid in the design of socially optimal policies for sustainable management of the Cheimaditida wetland, with possible implications for other similar wetlands in Greece and the rest of Europe.},

  abstract = {Waste pickers are widely regarded as among the most marginalised groupings in the informal economy. Theoretically, this can have a negative impact on the evaluation of their well-being. The aim of the research was to investigate possible determinants of subjective well-being in South Africa's informal economy, using a case study of waste pickers on landfill sites in the Free State province of South Africa. The data were sourced from structured interviews with 420 waste pickers on landfill sites in the three major municipalities in the Free State province in 2012. A mixed method research design was used in the research. The standard quantitative data analysis was supplemented with a qualitative analysis to provide deeper insight into the research question. The results are reported in context with the broader perspective of the labour market in South Africa. The results indicate the importance of location and size of the landfill in explaining the subjective well-being of the waste pickers. Further research is needed among other marginalised groups to gain a clearer understanding of the lives and livelihoods of those involved in the informal economy of South Africa. Society will then be better placed to value the contribution of informal waste pickers in the waste economy and policy makers will be better equipped to integrate them in the formal waste management strategies of municipalities.}

  abstract = {Black carbon (BC) is one of the short-lived air pollutants that contributes significantly to aerosol radiative forcing and global climate change. It is emitted by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass. Urban environments are quite complex and thus, the use of mobile jointly with fixed monitoring provides a better understanding of the dynamics of BC distribution in such areas. The present study addresses the measurement of BC concentration using real-time mobile and ambient monitoring in Barranquilla, an industrialized urban area of the Colombian Caribbean. A microaethalometer (MA200) and an aethalometer (AE33) were used for measuring the BC concentration. The absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent (AAE) values were determined for the study area, for identifying the BC emission sources. The results of the ambient sampling show that vehicle traffic emissions prevail; however, the influence of biomass burning was also observed. The mean ambient BC concentration was found to be 1.04~{$\pm~$}1.03~{$\mu$}g/m3 and varied between 0.5 and 4.0~{$\mu$}g/m3. From the mobile measurements obtained in real traffic conditions on the road, a much higher average value of 16.1~{$\pm~$}16.5~{$\mu$}g/m3 was measured. Many parts of the city showed BC concentrations higher than 20~{$\mu$}g/m3. The spatial distribution of BC concentration shows that vehicle emissions and traffic jams, a consequence of road and transport infrastructure, are the factors that most affect the BC concentration. A comparison of results obtained from two aethalometers indicates that the concentrations measured by MA200 are 9\% lower than those measured by AE33. The AAE obtained was found to vary between 1.1 and 1.6, indicating vehicular emissions as the most crucial source. In addition, it was observed that the BC concentration on working days was 2.5 times higher than on the weekends in the case of mobile monitoring and 1.5 times higher in the case of ambient monitoring.},

Funding was randomly assigned among screened and eligible groups. Treatment groups received unsupervised grants of \$382 per member. Grant recipients invest some in skills training but most in tools and materials. After four years, half practice a skilled trade. Relative to the control group, the program increases business assets by 57\%, work hours by 17\%, and earnings by 38\%. Many also formalize their enterprises and hire labor. We see no effect, however, on social cohesion, antisocial behavior, or protest. Effects are similar by gender but are qualitatively different for women because they begin poorer (meaning the impact is larger relative to their starting point) and because women's work and earnings stagnate without the program but take off with it. The patterns we observe are consistent with credit constraints.},

I depart from this emphasis, however, in my attempt to focus on the consequential and often contradictory role of material objects in producing enclosure. In particular, I emphasise the important work that hedges did, physically, symbolically and legally, in the dispossession of the commoner. Acting as an organic barbed wire, the hedge was increasingly put to work to protect the lands of the powerful. Disrupting the propertied spaces of the commoning economy, hedges were not surprisingly targeted by those who opposed privatisation. The hedge, as both a sign and material barrier, served complicated and sometimes opposing ends. It materialised private property's right to exclude, but thus came into conflict with common property's right not to be excluded. The hedge was both an edge to property and was itself property. Both the encloser and the commoner, however, had property interests in the hedge. If broken, the hedge could signal violence and riot, or the legitimate assertion of common right. The hedge served as an often formidable material barrier, yet this very materiality made it vulnerable to `breaking' and `leveling'.}

  abstract = {Plastic waste management is a challenge for the whole world. Manual sorting of garbage is a difficult and expensive process, which is why scientists create and study automated sorting methods that increase the efficiency of the recycling process. The plastic waste may be automatically chosen on a transmission belt for waste removal by using methods of image processing and artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, to improve the recycling process. Waste segregation techniques and procedures are applied to major groups of materials such as paper, plastic, metal, and glass. Though, the biggest challenge is separating different materials types in a group, for example, sorting different colours of glass or plastics types. The issue of plastic garbage is important due to the possibility of recycling only certain types of plastic (PET can be converted into polyester material). Therefore, we should look for ways to separate this waste. One of the opportunities is the use of deep learning and convolutional neural network. In household waste, the most problematic are plastic components, and the main types are polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. The main problem considered in this article is creating an automatic plastic waste segregation method, which can separate garbage into four mentioned categories, PS, PP, PE-HD, and PET, and could be applicable on a sorting plant or home by citizens. We proposed a technique that can apply in portable devices for waste recognizing which would be helpful in solving urban waste problems.},

Women and children spend hours a day collecting water: time that would be better spent in education or productive employment. Cognizant of this fact, the government and donor organizations are currently performing a number of activities to improve the coverage and quality of water supply with partial cost recovery systems. Hence, the affordability and willingness of the consumers that are supposed to be served need to be examined. The primary objective of this study is, therefore, to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) of rural households for improved water service provision and identify its determinant by employing contingent valuation method (CVM) in Haramaya district. The study used primary data obtained from a survey conducted on randomly selected rural households. We used double bounded dichotomous choice elicitation method administered by in-person interview. The data was analyzed using descripti ve statistics and bivariate probit model. Response to the hypothetical scenario revealed that sampled households expressed their WTP with a mean WTP of 27.30 cents per 20 liters jerrycan. The results of bivariate probit model revealed that household income, education, sex, time spent to fetch water, water treatment practice, quality of water and expenditure on water have positive and significant effects on WTP for improved water service provision, while age of the respondent has a negative and significant effect.},

Light absorption by particles emitted from low-technology coal combustion has exhibited a strong spectral dependence.

Following previous work on the structure of amorphous carbon, I propose that both the magnitude and spectral dependence of light absorption are controlled by the size of graphitic clusters within the material, and can be described using the optical band-gap theory. This hypothesis is an alternative to the current measurement divisions of light-absorbing ``black carbon'' and non-absorbing ``organic carbon,'' and offers an explanation for preferential absorption at blue wavelengths that may extend to ultraviolet wavelengths.},

  abstract = {AbstractBlack carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr-1 in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m-2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m-2. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m-2. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m-2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m-2. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m-2, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (-0.50 to +1.08) W m-2 during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (-0.06 W m-2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of -1.45 to +1.29 W m-2). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates.},

  abstract = {Background: Exposure to household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels in simple stoves is a major health risk. Modeling reliable estimates of solid fuel use is needed for monitoring trends and informing policy. Objectives: In order to revise the disease burden attributed to household air pollution for the Global Burden of Disease 2010 project and for international reporting purposes, we estimated annual trends in the world population using solid fuels. Methods: We developed a multilevel model based on national survey data on primary cooking fuel. Results: The proportion of households relying mainly on solid fuels for cooking has decreased from 62\% (95\% CI: 58, 66\%) to 41\% (95\% CI: 37, 44\%) between 1980 and 2010. Yet because of population growth, the actual number of persons exposed has remained stable at around 2.8 billion during three decades. Solid fuel use is most prevalent in Africa and Southeast Asia where {$>$} 60\% of households cook with solid fuels. In other regions, primary solid fuel use ranges from 46\% in the Western Pacific, to 35\% in the Eastern Mediterranean and {$<$} 20\% in the Americas and Europe. Conclusion: Multilevel modeling is a suitable technique for deriving reliable solid-fuel use estimates. Worldwide, the proportion of households cooking mainly with solid fuels is decreasing. The absolute number of persons using solid fuels, however, has remained steady globally and is increasing in some regions. Surveys require enhancement to better capture the health implications of new technologies and multiple fuel use.},

A multitude of grassroots organizational forms and approaches have emerged in response to challenges and limitations faced by informal workers and their organizations, reflecting contextual and sector specific factors. This article examines the relationships between informal workers Organizations, trade unions and NGOs, thereby demonstrating the importance of relationship building to increase visibility, influence and institutional power. Trade unions are particularly important and the article points to signs of a shift within the international trade union movement towards more supportive policy and practice. Also evident are national and international structures indicating a need to scale up into larger organizations to engage governments and to make an impact on global developments affecting informal workers' lives. In looking at these organizational forms the article concludes that there is no one organizational form or strategy that fits all, but that a flexible, multi faceted approach to organizing is required.]}

In this study, we prepared 33P radioisotopeand stable 15N isotope-labeled synthetic NUF (SNUF) and struvite using synthetic urine and determined P and N uptake by greenhouse-grown ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum var. Gemini) fertilized with these products. The P and N in the urine-based fertilizers were as readily plant-available in a slightly acidic soil as the P and N in reference mineral fertilizers. The ryegrass crop recovered 26 \% of P applied with both urine-based fertilizers and 72 and 75 \% of N applied as struvite and SNUF, respectively. Thus, NUF and urine-derived struvite are valuable N and P recycling fertilizers.},

This study explores the menstrual hygiene practices and knowledge of girls at rural government primary schools in the Rukungiri district in Uganda and assesses the extent to which poor menstrual hygiene management (MHM) affects their education. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was completed by schoolgirls in six government-run primary schools in the Rukungiri district. Focus groups were held with girls from each school and semi-structured interviews were conducted with headteachers and female teachers from the participating schools. A toilet assessment was also conducted in each school. Results: One hundred and forty schoolgirls completed the questionnaire. The girls reported a lack of access to adequate resources, facilities and accurate information to manage their menstrual hygiene effectively at school. They reported that, as a result, during menstruation they often struggle at school or miss school. Eightysix girls (61.7\%) reported missing school each month for menstrual-related reasons (mean 1.64, range 0-10, SD. 1.84). Conclusion: It is common for girls who attend government-run primary schools in the Rukungiri district to miss school or struggle in lessons during menstruation because they do not have access to the resources, facilities, or information they need to manage for effective MHM. This is likely to have detrimental effects on their education and future prospects. A large-scale study is needed to explore the extent of this issue.},

  abstract = {The need for the development of adaptation strategies for climate change in Africa is becoming critical. For example, infrastructure with a long lifespan now needs to be designed or adapted to account for a future climate that will be different from the past or present. There is a growing necessity for the climate information used in decision making to change from traditional science-driven metrics to decision-driven metrics. This is particularly relevant in East Africa, where limited adaptation and socio-economic capacity make this region acutely vulnerable to climate change. Here, we employ an interdisciplinary consultation process to define and analyse a number of such decision-oriented metrics. These metrics take a holistic approach, addressing the key East African sectors of agriculture, water supply, fisheries, flood management, urban infrastructure and urban health. A multifaceted analysis of multimodel climate projections then provides a repository of user-focused information on climate change and its uncertainties, for all metrics and seasons and two future time horizons. The spatial character and large intermodel uncertainty of changes in temperature and rainfall metrics are described, as well as those of other relevant metrics such as evaporation and solar radiation. Intermodel relationships amongst metrics are also explored, with two clear clusters forming around rainfall and temperature metrics. This latter analysis determines the extent to which model weights could, or could not, be applied across multiple climate metrics. Further work must now focus on maximising the utility of model projections, and developing tailored risk-based communication strategies.},

While this approach has led to valuable insights and has been important to further develop the research field, it provides little information on how to develop frugal innovations. This paper addresses this issue and contributes with an empirical ex-ante examination. This is done by analyzing the design and construction of a frugal technical equipment for Brazilian waste pickers. This newly developed cart was examined to assess its frugality and to derive success factors of the process. Frugality was achieved by decreased product costs of 60\%, increased income of the waste pickers by 20\% and improved social acceptance of the new equipment. Besides delivering a step-by-step manual on how frugal innovations can be developed, the study contrasted frugal New Product Development (fNPD) with conventional NPD, reconfirmed critical success factors of fNPD from prior research and extends these findings by three aspects: To consider both need identification and need integration in fNPD; To work with tools that allow the frugal reconfiguration of systems on a deep functional level to uncouple fNPD from traditional product notions, and to check cultural impact and societal desirability when organizing the innovation activities. The paper offers theoretical contributions to the research field of frugal innovation by enhancing its understanding as a process and its critical success factors for fNPD.},

We conducted a critical review of European and US BC source apportionment studies published since 2003. Since elemental carbon (EC) has been used as a surrogate measure of BC, we also considered source apportionment studies of EC measurements. This review extends the knowledge presented in previous ambient PM source apportionment reviews because we focus on BC and EC and critically examine the differences between source apportionment results for different methods and source categories. We identified about 50 BC and EC source apportionment studies that have been conducted in either Europe or the US since 2003, finding a striking difference in the commonly used source apportionment methods between the two regions and variations in the assigned source categories. Using three dominant methodologies (radiocarbon, aethalometer, and macro-tracer methods) that only allow for BC to be broadly apportioned into either fossil fuel combustion or biomass burning source categories, European studies generally support fossil fuel combustion as the dominant ambient BC source, but also show significant biomass burning contributions, in particular in wintertime at non-urban locations. Among US studies where prevailing methods such as chemical mass balance (CMB) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) models have allowed for estimation of more refined source contributions, there are fewer findings showing the significance of biomass burning and variable findings on the relative proportion of BC attributed to diesel versus gasoline emissions. Overall, the available BC source apportionment studies provide useful information demonstrating the significance of both fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning BC emission sources in Europe and the US, although further studies are needed to evaluate the uncertainties and comparability of the methodologies.},

  abstract = {Behaviour change communication is vital for increasing the enactment of particular behaviours known to promote health and growth. The techniques used to change behaviour are important for determining how successful the intervention is. In order to integrate findings from different interventions, we need to define and organize the techniques previously used and connect them to effectiveness data. This paper reviews 24 interventions and programs implemented to change four health behaviours related to child health in developing countries: the use of bed nets, hand washing, face washing and complementary feeding. The techniques employed are organized under six categories: information, performance, problem solving, social support, materials, and media. The most successful interventions use three or even four categories of techniques, engaging participants at the behavioural, social, sensory, and cognitive levels. We discuss the link between techniques and theories. We propose that program development would be more systematic if researchers considered a menu of technique categories appropriate for the targeted behaviour and audience when designing their studies.},

Of key importance for sustainable water implementation is an enabling environment that incorporates aspects such as funding, potential for market development, and supportive governance. While this enabling environment is acknowledged, the focus of this work is on the integration of three key areas: (i) social and cultural assessment of behavior and preferences; (ii) market-based implementation approaches that draw on this knowledge; and (iii) technology development for these markets.},

  abstract = {There are a number of advantages to small-scale biogas production on farms, including savings on firewood or fossil fuels and reductions in odour and greenhouse gas emissions. For these reasons, governments and development aid agencies have supported the installation of biogas digesters. However, biogas digesters are often poorly managed and there is a lack of proper distribution systems for biogas. This results in methane being released inadvertently through leaks in digesters and tubing, and intentionally when production exceeds demand. As methane has a global warming potential 25 times greater than that of carbon dioxide, this compromises the environmental advantages of digesters. Calculations performed in this paper indicate that the break-even point at which the released methane has as great an impact on global warming as the fuel that has been replaced occurs when between 3\% and 51\% of the produced biogas is released, depending on the type of fuel that has been replaced. The limited information available as regards methane leaking from small-scale biogas digesters in developing countries indicates that emissions may be as high as 40\%. With the best estimates of global numbers of small-scale digesters and their biogas production, this corresponds to methane losses of 4.5 Tg yr-1 or about 1\% of global emissions or 10\% as much as emissions from rice production. Further poliferation of small-scale digesters could therefore contribute significantly to global emissions of methane. It is therefore important that governments and development aid agencies place stricter requirements on digester maintenance and biogas handling before incentives are created and legislation introduced for the installation of small-scale biogas digesters.},

  abstract = {This thesis is a visual and textual ethnography about the lives of waste pickers on the Stueng Mean Chey Dumpsite in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Though much is presumed about the socio-economic situation of waste pickers in developing countries, this thesis seeks to dispel common stereotypes of picking being merely a means of survival for poor and transient populations, and provides detailed analysis of the economic and social situation of the people who worked on the dumpsite and lived in the nearby waste picker communities. By weaving together rich empirical research, embodying visuals and critical analysis, I highlight the pickers' agency, an effect seen in the choices that they made at the most mundane level when acting upon objects on the dumpsite, and at the most complex level in their relations with outsiders. Specifically, in drawing on the theoretical work of anthropologist Nancy Munn, I explore how positive and negative value and values were created through social actions of reclamation of discarded objects on the dumpsite, including an analysis of symbolic processes of ownership and the broader contestation of rights to an urban commons. In the capitalist recycling economy in which the waste pickers participated, the inseparability of their actions from the materiality and social life of the objects they acted on resulted in value transformation processes being enmeshed with politics of property relations. This study also highlights how their everyday acts on wasted objects manifested a distinct local social world governed by values regarded as important and significant for the community's sustainability. There was a visible yet often unspoken orientation by autonomous individuals to reinforce largely egalitarian communal values that enabled individual pickers to create and realise personal, social and economic value from waste. At the same time their acts on waste also created negative potentialities, most evident in acts to confront anomalies and prevent sickness and injury. Nevertheless these value creation processes were largely autonomous of outsiders. While the processes articulated closely with those of their recycling dealers, by and large, they cut across other value creation processes operating in different domains, some of which were fundamentally disconnected from that of the waste pickers. This is clearly represented in the stigma the waste pickers endured, their lowly status and the impact these devalued states had on intersubjective experiences with outsiders, including but not limited to aid workers, tourists and people seeking to attain merit who frequented the site. The waste pickers' communal value/s were further evidenced by their continued resilience in the face of ridicule and humiliation within wider processes of disarticulation, and their ability to largely maintain their values as others attempted to subvert them. As the Stueng Mean Chey Dumpsite closed during my fieldwork, the thesis concludes by exploring the transformations and interventions that impacted the waste pickers when a new sanitary landfill opened in the city.},

Specifically, harvests are the same for people who know they received the modern seeds and for people who did not know what type of seeds they got; however, people who knew they had received the traditional seeds did much worse.

This paper identifies pollutant concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) emission and air quality index categories with the peak hour interval on Hidar Sitaten day, and present analysis of air quality in Addis Ababa from August 2016 to November 2019. Daily records, with a 1-hour interval, of raw concentration of air pollutant and air quality index data, were obtained from the AirNow website of Addis Ababa central monitoring station. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics of the mean air quality index and concentration of PM2.5. Accordingly, the study revealed that the peak hour for high pollutant concentration emission ranges between 8\,pm to 11\,pm hours, and the mean air quality index was more than a moderate level. Particularly, on Hidar Sitaten in 2019 at 9\,pm the maximum concentration of PM2.5 was 8.6 times higher than WHO air quality guideline standard of daily allowance. The highest mean of air quality index and concentration of PM2.5 recorded was 112 and 44.2\,\textmu g/m3 on 21 November 2017, respectively, and it was found to be unhealthy for sensitive groups. This implies that the concentration of PM2.5 was harmful to people who are unusually sensitive to particulate pollution and have health problems. Therefore, public participation and strong regulations are needed on air quality management to strike a balance between a cultural practice of Hidar Sitaten and healthy air quality.},

This article assessed the current status of solid waste management in LDCs from waste generation to disposal. Solid waste generation in LDCs averages 0.56 kg/capita/day while the solid waste stream consists mainly of organics (52\%) followed by recyclables (26\%). Waste collection is also low and due to irregular waste collection, many people in LDCs resort to illegal practices such as illegal dumping or open burning of wastes. Sanitary landfilling is almost non-existent in LDCs with some of the few landfills present severely lacking in effective leachate or gas collection systems. While recycling is carried out in some LDCs, the most common practice is to collect recyclables for exportation. Similarly, composting of solid waste exists mainly on small-scale while biogas plants present in LDCs are used mostly for treatment of animal manure. Some of the challenges faced by LDCs include lack of funding, infrastructure, legislations, knowledge, and awareness on solid waste issues. However, there is a huge potential for job creation in the solid waste management field including waste collection, recycling, composting and even sanitary landfilling.},

Widespread improvement requires a cultural shift in both thinking and practice, and better education will be instrumental to achieve this. Here we argue that education in reproducible science should start at the grassroots. We present our model of consortium-based student projects to train undergraduates in reproducible team science. We discuss how with careful design we have aligned collaboration with the current conventions for individual student assessment. We reflect on our experiences of several years running the GW4 Undergraduate Psychology Consortium offering insights we hope will be of practical use to others wishing to adopt a similar approach. We consider the pedagogical benefits of our approach in equipping students with 21st-century skills. Finally, we reflect on the need to shift incentives to reward to team science in global research and how this applies to the reward structures of student assessment.},

\par
We view robust scientific findings as ones that are reproducible, replicable, and generalizable. Reproducibility, replication, and generalizability are different though related concepts that are vital to our discussion. In practice, these ideas are sometimes confounded or combined. Because writers do not always use these terms in the same way, we explain our usage. We make no claim to be providing the true meaning of these concepts, but do hope that these definitions clarify our meanings of the terms. 
\par
Reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials and procedures as were used by the original investigator. So in an attempt to reproduce a published statistical analysis, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis to determine whether they yield the same results. For example, a study might involve OLS regressions conducted using data from the 2014 American National Election Study survey. After publication of the results, another investigator using the same data can attempt to conduct the same analyses. If the same results were obtained, the first set of results would be deemed reproducible. If the same results were not obtained, the discrepancy could be due to differences in processing of the data, differences in the application of statistical tools, differences in the operations performed by the statistical tools, accidental errors by an investigator, and other factors. Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative. 
\par
Replicability refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected. That is, a failure to replicate a scientific finding is commonly thought to occur when one study documents relations between two or more variables and a subsequent attempt to implement the same operations fails to yield the same relations with the new data. It also is possible and useful to demonstrate the lack of relations between variables. For instance, an intervention might fail to produce an effect. A second study might investigate the same intervention in a different setting and also find no effect. Thus, null results can also be replicated. 
\par
When a single researcher is conducting his or her own study for a second time, it might seem easy to repeat the same data collection and analysis procedures, because the researcher is fully informed about the procedures. But when another researcher in another location did not observe the conduct of the first study and relies on a textual description of its data collection and analysis procedures, critical details may not be fully and effectively understood, so the procedures implemented second may not match the procedures implemented in the initial study. Thus, an apparent failure to replicate a finding may occur because importantly different procedures are used the second time. 
\par
More generally, failure to replicate can occur for a number of reasons, including: (1) the first study's methods were flawed, and the variables are not related to one another, (2) the second study's methods were flawed; the variables are truly related to one another, but this was misleadingly not revealed by the second study, (3) the two studies do not disagree with one another, because the association observed in the first study is not statistically significantly different from the association observed in the second study, once we take into account the sampling fluctuations that occur in both studies, or (4) the methods or participants used in the second study are substantively different from those used in the first study, so the second does not match the first in terms of key conditions (e.g., different types of people participated in the first and second studies). 
\par
Generalizability refers to whether the results of a study apply in other contexts or populations that differ from the original one. Generalization can be done from one set of human participants in an experiment to other people (e.g., findings generated with college student participants at a large Midwest university might be generalized to the entire U.S. adult population). Generalization can also be done from one persuasive message that was studied in a laboratory experiment to all persuasive messages that could be presented to people in the course of daily life. Generalizability concerns the degree to which found relations apply in different situations. Usually a finding's failure to generalize indicates the operation of limiting conditions, the identification of which advances theory.},

We find that PAPI data contain a large number of errors, which can be avoided in CAPI. Error counts are not randomly distributed across the sample, but are correlated with household characteristics, potentially introducing sample bias if dubious observations need to be dropped. We demonstrate a tendency for the spread of total measured consumption to be higher on paper compared to CAPI, translating into significantly higher measured inequality. Investigating further the nature of PAPI's measurement error for consumption, we fail to reject the hypothesis that it is classical: it attenuates the coefficient on consumption when used as explanatory variable and we find no evidence of bias when consumption is used as dependent variable. Finally, CAPI and PAPI are compared in terms of interview length, costs and respondents' perceptions.},

Under EPR, a producer's responsibility for its products is extended beyond the consumption stage, and the producer has to meet the targets of collection and recycling rates imposed by the EPR legislation. Motivated by the importance of this topic, in this paper, we conduct a systematic review on EPR from an operations management perspective. To be specific, we categorize the EPR literature, for both e-wastes and non-e-wastes, by research methodologies (qualitative case studies, quantitative empirical research, and analytical modeling studies) and discuss the respective findings. In addition to systematically exploring the state-of-the-art research within the context of EPR, we investigate pertinent issues, such as the implementation of EPR, EPR management systems, supply chain management under EPR, and EPR-related operations (such as end-of-life product management and design for recyclability). We highlight some EPR-related innovative measures and proposals in five areas, namely policy, product, process, supply chain, and technology. Finally, we discuss future research and propose a concluding picture of how EPR can help establish innovative operational measures to improve sustainability.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the evidence on the impact of cash-based interventions (CBIs) on the immediate, underlying and basic causes of food and nutrition security. Using a theoretical framework developed by the United Nations Children's Fund, we stress the high potential of CBIs for humanitarian and transitional assistance. In particular, given their great adaptability to contexts and needs as well as their ability to link short and long-term outcomes, it is clear that CBIs should form part of every response analysis. This holds despite challenges such as the need for markets and the difficulty of influencing the exact livelihood sector on which beneficiaries spend the cash. The German experience has so far focused more or less exclusively on one specific form of CBIs, i.e. cash-for-work programmes. These have been given a sharp boost by the recent refugee crisis in Syria and the neighbouring countries. While cash-for-work programmes provide participants with short-term, immediate income, it is more difficult to identify their longer-term effects. A greater willingness to make use of other types of CBI and thus the option of adapting more to contexts is a desirable next step for German development cooperation. Luis A.

  abstract = {Highways passing through cities cause additional pollution inside the city. However, most of the current studies are using ground-based monitoring technologies, which make it difficult to capture the dispersion patterns of pollutants near elevated highways or transportation interchanges. The purpose of this study is to discover short-term three-dimensional variations in traffic-related pollutants based on unmanned aerial vehicles. The monitoring locations are at suburban elevated highway and transportation interchanges. The monitoring parameters include the particle number concentration (PN), particle mass concentration (PM), and black carbon (BC). The vertical profiles showed that most air pollutants increased significantly with the height of the elevated highways. Compared with the ground level, PNs increased by 54\%\textendash 248\% and BC increased by 201\%. The decline rate of particle concentrations decreased with the increase of height and remained stable after 120 m. Furthermore, the R2 heatmap for regressions between each altitude showed that the linear relationship between 0\textendash 120 m was higher than that of other altitudes. In horizontal profiles, PNs spread to 100 m and then began to decline, BC began to decay rapidly after 50 m, but PMs varied less. After crossing another highway, PNs increased by 69\textendash 289\%, PMs by 7\textendash 28\%, and BC by 101\%. Furthermore, the formation of new particles was observed at both locations as PN3 increased with distance within 100 m from the highway. This paper fills in the void of three-dimensional in situ monitoring near elevated highways, and can help develop and refine a three-dimensional traffic-related air pollution dispersion model and assess the impacts of transportation facilities on the urban environment.},

WBE efforts to date have primarily focused on sewer-transported wastewater in high-income countries, but at least 1.8 billion people in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) use onsite sanitation systems such as pit latrines and septic tanks. Like wastewater, fecal sludges from such systems offer similar advantages in community pathogen monitoring and other epidemiological applications. To evaluate the distribution of enteric pathogens inside pit latrines\textendash which could inform sampling methods for WBE in LMIC settings unserved by sewers\textendash we collected fecal sludges from the surface, mid-point, and maximum-depth of 33 pit latrines in urban and peri-urban Malawi and analyzed the 99 samples for 20 common enteric pathogens via multiplex quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Using logistic regression adjusted for household population, latrine sharing, the presence of a concrete floor or slab, water source, and anal cleansing materials, we found no significant difference in the odds of detecting the 20 pathogens from the mid-point (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 1.1; 95\% confidence interval = 0.73, 1.6) and surface samples (aOR = 0.80, 95\% CI = 0.54, 1.2) compared with those samples taken from the maximum depth. Our results suggest that, for the purposes of routine pathogen monitoring, pit latrine sampling depth does not strongly influence the odds of detecting enteric pathogens by molecular methods. A single sample from the pit latrines' surface, or a composite of surface samples, may be preferred as the most recent material contributed to the pit and may be easiest to collect.},

The particulate matter is impacted on thin aluminum foil and copper grids for Transmission Electron Microscope. The analysis of HRTEM micrographs revealed the nanostructure and the particle size of soot chain. Results from the border-based fractal dimension indicated that main morphological differences observed in soot particles perhaps are associated to cook-stove chamber design. XPS analysis shows that particles are mainly composed by carbon and oxygen. The XPS C-1s spectra show carbon with three peaks corresponding to sp2, sp3 hybridization and carbon oxygen bond.

  abstract = {This paper discusses different design techniques for stated preference surveys in health economic applications. In particular, we focus on different design techniques, i.e. how to combine the attribute levels into alternatives and choice sets, for choice experiments. Design is a vital issue in choice experiments since the combination of alternatives in the choice sets will determine the degree of precision obtainable from the estimates and welfare measures. In this paper we compare orthogonal, cyclical and D-optimal designs, where the latter allows expectations about the true parameters to be included when creating the design. Moreover, we discuss how to obtain prior information on the parameters and how to conduct a sequential design procedure during the actual experiment in order to improve the precision in the estimates. The designs are evaluated according to their ability to predict the true marginal willingness to pay under different specifications of the utility function in Monte Carlo simulations. Our results suggest that the designs produce unbiased estimations, but orthogonal designs result in larger mean square error in comparison to D-optimal designs. This result is expected when using correct priors on the parameters in D-optimal designs. However, the simulations show that welfare measures are not very sensitive if the choice sets are generated from a D-optimal design with biased priors. Copyright \# 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Value estimates for environmental goods can be obtained by either estimating preference parameters as ``revealed'' through behavior related to some aspect of the amenity or using ``stated'' information concerning preferences for the good. In the environmental economics literature the stated preference approach has come to be known as ``contingent valuation'' as the ``valuation'' estimated obtained from preference information given the respondent is said to be ``contingent'' on the details of the ``constructed market'' for the environmental good put forth in the survey. Work on contingent valuation now typically comprises the largest single group of papers at major environmental economics conferences and in several of the leading journals in the field. As such, it is impossible to ``review'' the literature per se or even cover all of the major papers in the area in some detail. Instead, in this chapter we seek to provide a coherent overview of the main issues and how they fit together. The organization of the chapter is as follows. First, we provide an overview of the history of contingent valuation starting with its antecedents and foundational papers and then trace its subsequent development using several broad themes. Second, we put forth the theoretical foundations of contingent valuation with particular emphasis on ties to standard measures of economic welfare. Third, we look at the issue of existence/passive use considerations. Fourth, we consider the relationship of contingent valuation to information on preferences that can be obtained by observing revealed behavior and how the two sources of information might be combined. Fifth, we look at different ways in which preference information can be elicited in a CV survey, paying particular attention to the incentive structure posed by different elicitation formats. Sixth, we turn to econometric issues associated with these different elicitation formats. Seventh, we briefly consider survey design issues. Eighth, we look at issues related to survey administration and extrapolating the results obtained to the population of interest. Ninth, we describe the major controversies related to the use of contingent valuation and summarize the evidence. Finally, we provide some thoughts on where we think contingent valuation is headed in the future.},

  abstract = {Background: In 2005, India established a conditional cash transfer program called Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), to increase institutional delivery and encourage the use of reproductive and child health-related services. Objective: To assess the effect of maternal receipt of financial assistance from JSY on childhood immunizations, postpartum care, breastfeeding practices, and care-seeking behaviors. Methods: We use data from the latest district-level household survey (2007\textendash 2008) to conduct a propensity score matching analysis with logistic regression. We conduct the analyses at the national level as well as separately across groups of states classified as high-focus and non-high-focus. We carry out several sensitivity analyses including a subgroup analysis stratified by possession of an immunization card. Results: Receipt of financial assistance from JSY led to an increase in immunization rates ranging from 3.1 (95\%CI 2.2\textendash 4.0) percentage points for one dose of polio vaccine to 9.1 (95\%CI 7.5\textendash 10.7) percentage points in the proportion of fully vaccinated children. Our findings also indicate JSY led to increased post-partum check-up rates and healthy early breastfeeding practices around the time of childbirth. No effect of JSY was found on exclusive breastfeeding practices and care-seeking behaviors. Effect sizes were consistently larger in states identified as being a key focus for the program. In an analysis stratified by possession of an immunization card, there was little to no effect of JSY among those with vaccination cards, while the effect size was much larger than the base case results for those missing vaccination cards, across nearly all immunization outcomes. Conclusions: Early results suggest the JSY program led to a significant increase in childhood immunization rates and some healthy reproductive health behaviors, but the structuring of financial incentives to pregnant women and health workers warrants further review. Causal interpretation of our results relies on the assumption that propensity scores balance unobservable characteristics.},

The economics literature generally suggests that non-use values don't exist among the poor and in the informal sector of the economy. We examine this issue through a choice modeling experiment. A survey was conducted of rainforest communities who live on the banks of the Amazon River (Rio Solim\~oes), in the vicinity of proposed oil and gas pipelines. The data were analyzed in the choice modeling framework, revealing relatively high amounts of compensation that were necessary in order to accept the potential ecosystem damages associated with oil transport, even if the people were completely compensated for direct damages such as loss of access to productive resources. These results suggest that environmental quality is important for its own sake, a result that is very different from the implicit assumption among many economists.},

Such impacts are often associated with water supply accessibility (e.g. distance or collection time) and used to justify investment in improving access. Objective: To assess the relationship between the water source location and the quantity of water available in households from low and middle-income countries by identifying the effects of interventions aiming to improve access, and to compare the indicators and measures used to collect information. Methods: We systematically searched seven databases (i.e. Cairn, Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Women's Studies International) along with grey literature for articles reporting indicators and measures of accessibility and quantity. We found 6492 records, of which 20 studies were retained that met the review's inclusion criteria. Results: Most studies were conducted in rural settings and provided suggestive findings to describe an inverse relationship between accessibility and quantity. Overall, a wide range of indicators and measures were used to assess water accessibility and quantity in the selected studies along with their association. The lack of consistency raised concerns regarding comparability and reliability of these methods. Conclusions: The review findings support the hypothesis that the quantity of water available in households is a function of the source location, but the inconsistency in study outcomes highlights the need to further investigate the strength and effects of the relationship.},

Global progress remains a general indicator as it is unclear if access is equitable across groups of the population. Agenda 2030 calling for `leaving no one behind', there is a need to focus on the variations of access in different groups of the population, especially in the context of low- and middle-income countries including Malawi. We analyzed data from Demographic Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) to describe emerging trends on progress and inequalities in water supply and sanitation services over a 25-year period (1992\textendash 2017), as well as to identify the most vulnerable populations in Malawi. Data were disaggregated with geographic and socio-economic characteristics including regions, urban and rural areas, wealth and education level. Analysis of available data revealed progress in access to water and sanitation among all groups of the population. The largest progress was generally observed in the groups that were further behind at the baseline year, which likely reflects good targeting in interventions/improvements to reduce the gap in the population. Overall, results demonstrated that some segments of the population \textendash{} foremost poorest Southern rural populations \textendash{} still have limited access to water and are forced to practise open defecation. Finally, we suggest including standardized indicators that address safely managed drinking water and sanitation services in future surveys and studies to increase the accuracy of national estimates.},

Interventions to improve access to safe water at the point of collection are essential, but water safety at the point of consumption is also an important consideration. This research aimed to 1) improve understanding of household practices in collecting water with respect to seasonality, and 2) to further assess risk associated with post-collection contamination from the point of collection to the point of consumption. A seasonal cohort study, including 115 households, was conducted in Malawi. Along with household surveys and observations, samples of water were tested for microbial water quality at four different stages of water collection: water source, collection container, storage container, cup of drinking water. Using E. coli as an indicator of contamination (cfu/100 ml), the risk of post-collection contamination was assessed. The results indicate that most water sources were free from contamination; contamination was proportionally lower in the dry season when more sources were found to be classified as having a very low risk of contamination. However, the level of risk of contamination was more likely to increase following collection in water sources that were initially free from contamination. Results show that the degradation in water quality from the point of collection to the point of consumption was more important in the rainy season, which is likely to be driven by the effect of seasonality on the household environment. Filling the collection container at the point of collection and storage at the point of consumption were found to be critical stages for an increased risk of E. coli contamination. Understanding household practices in accessing and handling water during both rainy and dry season is necessary to target appropriate interventions to reduce post-collection contamination.},

A prospective cohort study was conducted in Malawi, and data were collected using structured household questionnaires and water quality testing. Results showed that households fetching water were more likely to rely on multiple water sources during the rainy season, compared to the dry season. When access to a single water source is insufficient, and/or the main water source is broken or not functional, households use additional water sources that are more likely to be contaminated or distant as a coping strategy. Water source reliability (i.e., functionality and availability) and proximity to water sources (i.e., time to collect water, waiting time) were found to be the most important factors influencing households' preferences. Ensuring reliable and continuous access, throughout the seasons, to at least a single water source that is located in proximity to the household is a key intervention to reduce the fetching burden.},

  abstract = {Managing solid waste in developing cities is not an easy task and many public policies have failed to bring the expected results. It is here argued that comprehending the solid waste handling in the South implies reconsidering the proper definition of waste. Where does the product end and where does rubbish begin? The answer to this question is far from being obvious. Solid waste appears as a blurred concept. Such a thorny issue is all the more relevant today, as municipal solid waste management approaches in the developing world are being reformulated: dumping sites are banned, sanitary landfills are imposed, and separate collection is being introduced. The current sector transformations are here analysed through a novel theoretical analysis combined with an original qualitative and quantitative empirical work.Through two case-studies of one-million inhabitant cities from emerging countries, it is shown that if appropriation conflicts arise that is because the urban solid waste deposit in Southern countries can be defined as an impure public good. This issue does not only involve private service operators and informal wastepickers; several other actors covet the urban solid waste deposit?s cream, that is, recyclable items. In emerging countries, huge industrial groups are starting to target domestic recyclable waste as an alternative for raw materials, which costs are increasing ever more.},

With the rise of big data and data science, it has become increasingly clear that students want, expect, and need explicit training in this area of the discipline. Additionally, recent curricular guidelines clearly state that working with data requires extensive computing skills and that statistics students should be fluent in accessing, manipulating, analyzing, and modeling with professional statistical analysis software. Much has been written in the statistics education literature about pedagogical tools and approaches to provide a practical computational foundation for students. This article discusses the computational infrastructure and toolkit choices to allow for these pedagogical innovations while minimizing frustration and improving adoption for both our students and instructors.

  abstract = {Computing makes up a large and growing component of data science and statistics courses. Many of those courses, especially when taught by faculty who are statisticians by training, teach R as the programming language. A number of instructors have opted to build much of their teaching around use of the tidyverse. The tidyverse, in the words of its developers, "is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next" (Wickham et al. 2019). The shared principles have led to the widespread adoption of the tidyverse ecosystem. No small part of this usage is because the tidyverse tools have been intentionally designed to ease the learning process and cognitive load for users as they engage with each new piece of the larger ecosystem. Moreover, the functionality offered by the packages within the tidyverse spans the entire data science cycle, which includes data import, visualisation, wrangling, modeling, and communication. We believe the tidyverse provides an effective and efficient pathway to data science mastery for students at a variety of different levels of experience. In this paper, we introduce the tidyverse from an educator's perspective, touching on the what (a brief introduction to the tidyverse), the why (pedagogical benefits, opportunities, and challenges), the how (scoping and implementation options), and the where (details on courses, curricula, and student populations).},

  abstract = {Plastic waste is currently generated at a rate approaching 400 Mt year-1. The amount of plastics accumulating in the environment is growing rapidly, yet our understanding of its persistence is very limited. This Perspective summarizes the existing literature on environmental degradation rates and pathways for the major types of thermoplastic polymers. A metric to harmonize disparate types of measurements, the specific surface degradation rate (SSDR), is implemented and used to extrapolate half-lives. SSDR values cover a very wide range, with some of the variability arising due to degradation studies conducted in different natural environments. SSDRs for high density polyethylene (HDPE) in the marine environment range from practically 0 to approximately 11 {$\mu$}m year-1. This approach yields a number of interesting insights. Using a mean SSDR for HDPE in the marine environment, linear extrapolation leads to estimated half-lives ranging from 58 years (bottles) to 1200 years (pipes). For example, SSDRs for HDPE and polylactic acid (PLA) are surprisingly similar in the marine environment, although PLA degrades approximately 20 times faster than HDPE on land. Our study highlights the need for better experimental studies under well-defined reaction conditions, standardized reporting of rates, and methods to simulate polymer degradation using.},

  abstract = {Traditional fired clay bricks are widely used as a fundamental building material in most countries. Availability, low costs and low-skilled labour are main factors that have made the bricks a popular choice. However with rising awareness to reduce carbon footprint and promote sustainable development, earth-making has taken a different path to minimize the environmental impact. Compressed stabilised earthbrick is an example of the alternative building material. Various efforts have been directed to develop these bricks, including the use of different binding agents, raw materials and technology. In conjunction with these progresses, and considering that strength is the primary concern in brick-making, it was conceived that a strength prediction model ought to be established to assist in the bricks' production, especially in the mix design stage. In collaboration with a local property developer, the Research Centre for Soft Soils (RECESS) has embarked on an industrial research project to develop ``green'' sustainable compressed stabilised earthbricks in situ for a large scale mixed development site. As part of the joint research effort, a series of trial specimens were prepared at different mix ratios using soil samples retrieved from the site. The specimens were next examined with the conventional compressive strength test, coupled with the novel non-destructive S-wave velocity measurement. The test results were then analysed and cross-correlated to establish a strength prediction model for the bricks produced. The charts relating the relevant parameters serve not only as a quick guide to the expected strength, but also provide insights to the behaviour of compressed stabilised material under loading.},

  abstract = {The mapping of indigenous lands to secure tenure, manage natural resources, and strengthen cultures is a recent phenomenon, having begun in Canada and Alaska in the 1960s and in other regions during the last decade and a half. A variety of methodologies have made their appearance, ranging from highly participatory approaches involving village sketch maps to more technical efforts with geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. In general, indigenous mapping has shown itself to be a powerful tool and it has spread rapidly throughout the world. The distribution of mapping projects is uneven, as opportunities are scarce in many parts of the world. This review covers the genesis and evolution of indigenous mapping, the different methodologies and their objectives, the development of indigenous atlases and guidebooks for mapping indigenous lands, and the often uneasy mix of participatory community approaches with technology. This last topic is at the center of considerable discussion as spatial technologies are becoming more available and are increasingly used in rural areas. The growth of GIS laboratories among tribes in the United States and Canada, who frequently have both financial and technical support, is in sharp contrast to groups in the South\textemdash primarily Africa, Asia, and Latin America\textemdash where resources are in short supply and permanent GIS facilities are rare.},

\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Visual Inspection: This is a yes/no inspection determining, whether the waste in the bin seems clean enough (meaning that the percentage of waste is less 1\% of mass)

\item 
Bio waste Bonitur: Is a more detailed visible analysis for grading the quality of waste. Thereby the amount of waste visible to the inspector in a certain control volume (5m\^2) is counted. The counted number determines the quality of the waste and its future us.

\item 
Batch analysis: Hereby, a spot check on a full vehicle load will be performed. It involves a manual sorting of a randomly selected control volume of 250 Kg material of the chosen load. 

\item 
Area Analysis: It is the inspection on impurities in bio waste in larger disposal area similar to the batch analysis. This type of analysis allows a more quantitative approach giving information about the region where the bio-waste was taken from. Furthermore, it also gives information about what type of bio waste it is. Depending on whether the bio waste is from rural or urbanized areas the impurity content can drastically vary. The impurity content for rural areas is about 0.4 - 4\%. As most of its bio waste consists of gardening waste, while the urbanized areas reach values of about 4 - 9 \% impurities. The urban waste often consists of kitchen waste of the citizen, where the tendency of carelessly or intentional misplacement of plastics and other inappropriate materials is more common. Furthermore, the collection points in cities is often communal which leads to a more anonymous disposal of waste.

Yet little is known about what technologies are used by ? or impact on ? the working poor in the informal economy, and in what ways. This paper presents findings from a 2015 study by the WIEGO network and local partners in three cities: Ahmedabad, India; Durban, South Africa; and Lima, Peru. The findings reveal that informal workers in the study cities are using diverse tools, from manual devices to electrical equipment and internet platforms, to strengthen their livelihoods. Overall, the tools used tend to be basic. Often they are being adapted in ingenious ways in order to adapt to resource and other constraints. Take-up of improved tools is limited by low incomes and concerns about theft and confiscation. It is also affected by city-level, context-specific systems of energy, transport and waste. This paper summarizes which types of technologies are most useful to different sectors of informal workers. It argues that the policy and regulatory environment, and city-wide technological systems, should be more responsive to the technological and other needs of the urban informal workforce.},

Previous studies neglected the impact of municipal residents' behavioral decisions on recycling sectors. In this study, the degree of regret-joy and personality characteristics were introduced into a multi-agent-based model to simulate the action decision-making of agents under different strategies. The results demonstrate that, without the government's role, nearly 60\% of municipal residents preferred the informal recycling sector (IFRS). Meanwhile, the formal recycling sectors (FRS) find it difficult to attract urban residents because of their low income levels. Regarding a single policy, the subsidy policy is more beneficial than the regulation policy for increasing the income of the FRS from 20 to 250 Yuan. However, neither of the two single policies can weaken the market competitiveness of the IFRS. Moreover, a comprehensive policy combining both subsidies and regulations has enabled more than 60\% of urban residents to choose the FRS, thereby increasing its profit and market share to 270 yuan and 500~kg, respectively. These results provide policy suggestions for optimizing the waste recycling management systems.},

We conducted a survey of 450 respondents across all three municipalities of Dar es Salaam to analyze the relationship between satisfaction with waste management services and preference for government leadership in the sector. We find that people who are dissatisfied with their current waste management service are twice as likely to prefer government leadership over alternatives, such as community organizations, than people who are satisfied. The finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, since the government is currently not active in waste management, citizens prefer more policy intervention if they consider their current situation unacceptable. To our understanding, this is the first article to use survey data to analyze the role of public opinion in waste management in a major city in a developing country.},

Despite significant progress in sanitation and water access, faecal-oral infections persist in these populations. Therefore, a better understanding of these transmission pathways, and how potential risk factors can be reduced within low income contexts is needed. This study, conducted in Southern Malawi from June to October 2017, used a mixed methods approach to collect data from household surveys (n = 323), checklists (n = 31), structured observations (n = 80), and microbiological food samples (n = 20). Results showed that food prepared for immediate consumption (primarily porridge for children) posed a low health risk. Poor hygiene practices increased the risk of contamination from shared family meals. Faecal and nosocomial bacteria were associated with poor hand hygiene and unhygienic eating conditions. Leftover food storage and inadequate preconsumption heating increased the risk of contamination. Improvements in food hygiene and hand hygiene practices at critical points could reduce the risk of diarrhoeal disease for children under 2 years but must consider the contextual structural barriers to improved practice like access to handwashing facilities, soap, food and water storage.},

This study explores the factors that enable or constrain the livelihood activity of people who collect cans and bottles at football tailgating parties, focusing on the motivation behind choices and the factors that enhance or constrain their activities. Maximum variation (heterogeneity) sampling, a purposeful sampling method, was used to recruit participants from different races, genders, and age groups. Data were collected through direct observation and semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings indicate that the income from this livelihood activity was an important survival strategy for those who engage in it. Other significant sources of motivation include contributing to environmental stewardship and recognition for doing so. Differences in capital assets such as social networks, physical strength, skills, and access to equipment led to differences in people\&rsquo;s ability to earn income from collecting cans and bottles. Some challenges restricted their activities, including accessing shopping carts and public buses to transport the cans and limitations imposed on the number of cans that canners can redeem at the redemption centers.},

Organo-mineral fertilizers can be formulated from different mass streams of biological origin: biomass processed by biological conversion (aerobic or anaerobic), chemical conditioning (acids or alkali), or thermal processes (combustion, pyrolysis). Through a combination of different types of processed biomass (e.g., biosolids conditioned with mineral acid can be neutralized and granulated with ashes from the biomass combustion) and by composition correction, it is possible to produce organic-mineral fertilizers. Particular attention was paid to relevant law (agriculture and non-agricultural applications) and technological problems such as large-scale installations. The available fertilizer production technologies constitute a part of the concept of bio-based circular economy, which in turn could lead to sustainable development as envisioned by the new European Green Deal strategy.},

From a participant's perspective, a business development process is narrated, showing how innovation management in partnerships evolves: through socially and culturally influenced negotiations that shape the technology in question. This study investigates both the external and internal challenges in adapting Danish technology to Vietnam though a North\textendash South partnership, in a physical, legislative and market context, and contributes to understanding the issues that arise the early stages of these partnerships. The partnership's business concept deals with the proposed introduction of improved, Danish solid waste separation and treatment technology at a plant in a suburb of Hanoi. The technology enables the production of derived products, such as organic fertilizer, and is suitable for biogas-based electricity production. This case study highlights issues for partnership facilitation: careful partner selection, managing different interests, cultural differences, and securing joint ownership in constructing a solution, while also showing the need for a comprehensive understanding of these issues. Additionally, the study shows that the technology is capital-intensive and requires financially viable supportive policies and subsidies, as well as a robust organic fertilizer market.},

It explores the specific challenges and opportunities faced by networks of the marginalized, and their allies, as they attempt to transform neoliberal global governance. The Global Alliance of Waste Pickers, a transnational advocacy network of informal recyclers and their allies, sought to influence the practices of the Clean Development Mechanism between 2009 and 2015. I assess their efforts via a ``historical dialectic'' framework that bridges neo-Gramscian theory with liberal constructivist scholarship. It differentiates between more and less ``embedded'' networks, categorizes distinct forms of policy change, and helps us to understand the factors that contribute to more or less transformative policy gains. I identify four distinct forms of policy: transformative, concessional, problem-solving, and maintenance. I argue that the network gained mostly concessional, rather than transformative, changes. My analysis suggests that concessional gains are likely in contexts in which embedded advocacy networks effectively combine discursive and institutional forms of leverage but fail to mobilize political leverage in the form of a powerful ``counterhegemonic bloc.''}

The first is work conducted to change social norms, particularly using theory that emerged from studies in social psychology. The second is work done on gender norms, emerging historically from feminist scholars working to counter gender inequality. As these two streams of work intersect, conceptual clarity is needed to understand differences and similarities between these two traditions. Increased clarity will improve efforts to address harmful norms and practices. In this article, we review similarities and differences between social and gender norms, reviewing the history of the concepts and identifying key tension points of contrast. We identified six areas of comparison that might be helpful for practitioners working for the promotion of global health as they make sense of social and gender norms. We then offer a definition of gender norms for practitioners and researchers working at the intersection between these two theories. Our definition draws from the two different streams of thought of how norms influence people's actions, acknowledging the double nature of gender norms: beliefs nested in people's minds and embedded in institutions that profoundly affect health-related behaviours and shape differential access to health services.},

Methods and analysis                                We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =\textasciitilde 130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM                 2.5                 ), nitrogen oxides (NO                 x                 ), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities.

This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper aims to understand the uses of technology in the informal recycling sector. We investigated the case of Relix, in northeast Brazil. The Relix project consists of cultural and educational interventions that promote recyclable waste picking and provides a mobile application to connect the local population to waste pickers. Methodological procedures included semistructured interviews with different groups of stakeholders. We adopted the Multilevel and pluralistic conceptual framework to analyze the groups according to the use of technology and perceptions in which they live based on context, process, and content. Results demonstrate that although the mobile application (app) can help waste pickers and the population to connect, it cannot single-handedly promote any meaningful changes in the lives of people. Additional actions should be taken. This study has two important contributions. First, it describes how the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can improve working conditions and create more innovative and equitable environments. Second, it enriches the theoretical discussion on the use of technology in social practice and the advances of applying a theoretical framework in the context of informal recycling.},

Design/methodology/approach Qualitative case studies were used, including interviews, observations and document analyses. The authors compared informal waste management in two cities of the Global South: Accra (Ghana) and Porto Alegre (Brazil). Findings The analysis points out that informal waste pickers play a crucial role in the implementation of waste policies in both cities, despite differing economic, social and institutional contexts. The study of the waste management system also points to multiple connections between informal and formal parts of the economy. Although the informal waste pickers are integral to the waste management systems, their economically disadvantaged position excludes them from the formal labour market. Faced with these challenges, they develop creative solutions to guarantee their livelihood and gain more effective collective voice. Research limitations/implications The comparison of two case studies, conducted about the same social phenomenon in two different economic, institutional and social contexts, has limited generalisability but is theoretically and practically important. Practical implications The findings are relevant to policy-makers who deal with urban waste management and for organisations who develop support actions for informal workers. Originality/value The authors draw on a comparison of qualitative case studies to explore the multidimensionality of the waste picker's phenomenon. This paper sparks discussion among scholars and experts who study the informal economy from different perspectives, in this case bridging insights from sociology and victimology.}

We want to build on recent studies on the role of informal waste-pickers by highlighting one particular aspect: the degree waste-pickers are organized into cooperatives. Stimulated by the paradox that, despite the apparent advantages of waste-picker cooperatives, not all waste-pickers in the cities are members of a cooperative, we have made a comparative study of waste-picking in Belo Horizonte (Brazil) and Surabaya (Indonesia). We focus on three aspects: waste as an (economic) resource, the low social status of waste-pickers, and their role in urban solid waste management. We shall argue that not only do cooperatives have positive effects on waste-picking but there are also negative consequences.}

  abstract = {This paper presents two case studies on the efforts by a community-based organisation to promote a sustainable integrated waste management system in Indian mega cities. This effort was initiated in 1989 by a local non-governmental organisation (NGO) called EXNORA and is based on a `zero waste management scheme' set up, run and financed by the residents themselves. As this model has been widely quoted as successful, the study aims at learning from two communities implementing this model. Results are reported from a survey of the two schemes that used various tools to assess both their performance and sustainability in selected residential areas of two Indian cities, Chennai and Hyderabad. The results indicate limited success of the schemes both in saving a significant fraction of the generated waste from dumping, and in rehabilitating the local poor. However, they show that motivated individuals can successfully set up and manage waste collection systems that lead to overall environmental improvements. The differences in the two schemes reflect how the local assets and contexts impact on the success of the scheme. The scheme in a rich neighbourhood of Hyderabad was less ambitious in its overall objectives and focussed on the provision of a waste management service, using the opportunity to provide local employment to a socially deprived fraction of the population. The scheme in a middle-class area of Chennai, although pioneering in its approach, suffered from diseconomies of scale and lack of social integration, making it less viable in the medium to long term. Both schemes suffered from a lack of community involvement, motivation and political support, which threatens the long-term sustainability of the enterprise. The research concludes that the role that communities can realistically play in management of their own waste depends on the local context. The system advocated by EXNORA seems to require significant local resources, and political and technical support which are hard to find and sustain without strong local leaders. Another model set up in the city of Visakhapatnam is finally introduced as an alternative. This is based on triangular contracts between the municipality, the residents and micro-enterprises and may provide a good solution in dealing with the technical and commercial aspects which communities find difficult.},

  abstract = {Part of urban sustainability strategies, waste recycling is an activity that can provide environmental, sanitary, social and economic benefits. However, despite its relevance, it has not been entirely developed. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to identify the restraining forces that have limited the expansion of waste recycling. The research was carried out through a collective case study in Brazil, where besides preserve natural resources, waste recycling creates employment and wealth. Two contrasting cases were studied: a newly-implemented program and a well-established one. Data collection included documental research, in loco observation, 800 closed quantitative interviews with householders and 33 guided qualitative interviews within waste pickers, scrap dealers, recycling industries' managers and local administrators. The main barriers identified were the lack of knowledge about practical and operational aspects of programs, an unequal sharing of the costs and benefits of recycling, a deficient infrastructure and a shortfall of professional management. The better understanding of these barriers can improve waste recycling in distinct urban contexts, as some of the barriers have been found in other developed and developing countries. They can also aid local administrations to perceive and overcome problems in different urban activities.},

Without phosphorus, food could not be produced, yet phosphorus is mined from fi nite reserves, most of which are controlled by only a few countries1 (UNEP 2011; Jasinski 2015; Cordell and White 2014). Fertilizer prices are likely to increase as fi nite reserves become critically scarce. Globally, a billion farmers and their families cannot access fertilizer markets and many rely on phosphorus-defi cient soils that produce low crop yields (IFPRI 2003). Moreover, mismanagement along the phosphorus supply chain from mine to fi eld to fork has resulted in massive losses and waste, which largely ends up in waterways, causing nutrient pollution and algal blooms (Bennett, Carpenter and Caraco 2001). The global phosphorus challenge is inherently complex; it is as much about international relations as farm soil fertility. It transcends disciplines, sectors, and scales \textendash{} from geopolitics to ecology to nutrition. In this chapter, we describe and refl ect upon a new project using a novel transdisciplinary approach to address this phosphorus challenge.},

Population and Setting A representative sample of children aged 9, 11, or 13 years in 1993 (349 [25\%] of whom are American Indian) were assessed for psychiatric and substance use disorders through age 21 years (1993-2006). Of the 1420 who participated in 1993, 1185 were interviewed as adults. From 1996, when a casino opened on the Indian reservation, every American Indian but no non-Indians received an annual income supplement that increased from \$500 to around \$9000. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of adult psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 3 age cohorts, adjusted for age, sex, length of time in the family home, and number of Indian parents. Results As adults, significantly fewer Indians than non-Indians had a psychiatric disorder (106 Indians [weighted 30.2\%] vs 337 non-Indians [weighted 36.0\%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.72; P=.001), particularly alcohol and cannabis abuse, dependence, or both. The youngest age-cohort of Indian youth had the longest exposure to the family income. Interactions between race/ethnicity and age cohort were significant. Planned comparisons showed that fewer of the youngest Indian age-cohort had any psychiatric disorder (31.4\%) than the Indian middle cohort (41.7\%; OR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.24-0.78; P=.005) or oldest cohort (41.3\%; OR, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.94; P=.01) or the youngest non-Indian cohort (37.1\%; OR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.48-0.90; P=.008). Study hypotheses were not upheld for nicotine or other drugs, or emotional or behavioral disorders. The income supplement received in adulthood had no impact on adult psychopathology. Conclusion Lower prevalence of psychopathology in American Indian youth following a family income supplement, compared with the nonexposed, non-Indian population, persisted into adulthood.},

  abstract = {Recycling is widely assumed to be environmentally beneficial, although the collection, sorting and processing of materials into new products also entails significant environmental impacts. This study compares the relative environmental impacts of a recycling system (incorporating the kerbside collection of recyclable materials and their subsequent use by manufacturers), with a waste disposal system (in which the waste is disposed to landfill and primary raw materials are used in manufacture), using the technique of lifecycle assessment. The methodology is then extended to incorporate an economic evaluation of the environmental impacts. This combination of lifecycle assessment and economic evaluation can be termed `Lifecycle Evaluation'. Lifecycle assessment quantifies and evaluates the environmental impacts of a product from the acquisition of raw materials, through manufacture and use, to final disposal. Lifecycle assessment can also provide a framework for the analysis of environmental impacts from systems such as transport, or waste management, as demonstrated in this paper. The results, for a case study of Milton Keynes in Central England, show that the recycling system generally performs better than the waste disposal system in terms of contribution to global warming, acidification effects and nutrification of surface water. An alternative method of analysis is then used, in which an economic valuation of the environmental impacts is carried out. This produces net benefits for recycling, per tonne of material, of \textsterling 1769 for aluminium, \textsterling 238 for steel, \textsterling 226 for paper and \textsterling 188 for glass, and net costs of \textsterling 2.57 for high density polyethylene (HDPE), \textsterling 4.10 for poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) and \textsterling 7.28 for poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET). It is concluded that lifecycle evaluation, the combination of lifecycle assessment and economic valuation, can be applied to a variety of waste management issues such as the appraisal of alternative methods of collection for recycling or an examination of the UK waste management hierarchy. This technique allows impacts to be expressed in homogenous units, and the inclusion of social and environmental impacts that would not normally be addressed within a lifecycle assessment. The approach would also facilitate the evaluation of environmental and social effects at a local level, which are particularly crucial to the success of community recycling schemes. Lifecycle evaluation could provide a powerful tool to aid the development of sustainable waste management and recycling policy.},

Despite their growing popularity, there is limited evidence on how CCT programs affect conflict and theoretical predictions are ambiguous. We estimate the effect of conditional cash transfers on civil conflict in the Philippines by exploiting an experiment that randomly assigned eligibility for a CCT program at the village level. We find that cash transfers caused a substantial decrease in conflict-related incidents in treatment villages relative to control villages. Using unique data on local insurgent influence, we also find that the program significantly reduced insurgent influence in treated villages.},

  abstract = {Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs are an increasingly popular tool for reducing poverty in conflict-affected areas. Despite their growing popularity, there is limited evidence on how CCT programs affect conflict and theoretical predictions are ambiguous. We estimate the effect of conditional cash transfers on civil conflict in the Philippines by exploiting an experiment that randomly assigned eligibility for a CCT program at the village level. We find that cash transfers caused a substantial decrease in conflict-related incidents in treatment villages relative to control villages in the first 9months of the program. Using unique data on local insurgent influence, we also find that the program reduced insurgent influence in treated villages. An analysis of possible spillovers yields inconclusive results. While we find no statistical evidence of spillovers, we also cannot rule out that the village-level effect was due to displacement of insurgent activity from treatment to control villages.},

  abstract = {Recycling of plastics is urged by the need for closing material loops to maintain our natural resources when striving towards circular economy, but also by the concern raced by observations of plastic scrap in oceans and lakes. Packaging industry is the sector using the largest share of plastics, hence packaging dominates in the plastic waste flow. The aim of this paper was to sum up the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging waste in Finland. This potential was evaluated based on the quantity, composition and mechanical quality of the plastic packaging waste generated by consumers and collected as a source-separated fraction, within the mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) or within energy waste. Based on the assessment 86,000\textendash 117,000 tons (18 kg/person/a) of post-consumer plastic packaging waste was generated in Finland in 2014. The majority, 84\% of the waste was in the mixed MSW flow in 2014. Due to the launching of new sorting facilities and separate collections for post-consumer plastic packaging in 2016, almost 40\% of the post-consumer plastic packaging could become available for recycling. However, a 50\% recycling rate for post-consumer plastic packaging (other than PET bottles) would be needed to increase the overall MSW recycling rate from the current 41\% by around two percentage points. The share of monotype plastics in the overall MSW plastics fraction was 80\%, hence by volume the recycling potential of MSW plastics is high. Polypropylene (PP) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were the most common plastic types present in mixed MSW, followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). If all the Finnish plastic packaging waste collected through the three collection types would be available for recycling, then 19,000\textendash 25,000 tons of recycled PP and 6000\textendash 8000 tons of recycled HDPE would be available on the local market. However, this assessment includes uncertainties due to performing the composition study only on mixed MSW plastic fraction. In order to obtain more precise figures of the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging, more studies should be performed on both the quantities and the qualities of plastic wastes. The mechanical and rheological test results indicated that even plastic wastes originating from the mixed MSW, can be useful raw materials. Recycled HDPE showed a smaller decline in the mechanical properties than recycled PP. The origin and processing method of waste plastic seemed to have less effect on the mechanical quality than the type of plastic. The applicability of a plastic waste for a product needs to be assessed case by case, due to product specific quality requirements. In addition to mechanical properties, the chemical composition of plastic wastes is of major importance, in order to be able to restrict hazardous substances from being circulated undesirably. In addition to quantity and quality of plastic wastes, the sustainability of the whole recycling chain needs to be assessed prior to launching operations so that the chain can be optimized to generate both environmental and economic benefits to society and operators.},

A review of 56 published studies is presented on the effect of stabilization on the performance characteristics of soil blocks. The review found that few studies have been conducted on durability properties of enhanced soil blocks as compared with physico-mechanical properties. Fibre-enhanced soil blocks tended to have peak performance with an optimal content that achieved maximum performance. The maximum performance improvement was generally less than a doubling of the strength of the soil without the fibres. Binders showed a continual improvement with greater concentrations, so much greater improvements can be obtained if the economic and social costs can be justified. Both fibres and binders have variable performance on water absorption with both reductions and increases possible. Generally, both fibre and binder inclusion in soil blocks enhance the performance characteristics of the blocks. Binders are typically more effective on a mass-fraction basis. However the supply of fibres is usually at a lower cost and a reduced environmental impact, and therefore may have a better performance on a per-cost or per-impact basis.},

Limited evidence exists on the association between different biomass fuels and health outcomes. We report results from a cross-sectional sample of 655 households in Malawi. We calculated odds ratios between hypothesized determinants of household air pollution (HAP) exposure (fuel, stove type, and cooking location) and five categories of health outcomes (cardiopulmonary, respiratory, neurologic, eye health, and burns). Reliance on high- or low-quality firewood or crop residue (vs. charcoal) was associated with significantly higher odds of shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chest pains, night phlegm, forgetfulness, dizziness, and dry irritated eyes. Use of high-quality firewood was associated with significantly lower odds of persistent phlegm. Cooks in rural areas (vs. urban areas) had significantly higher odds of experiencing shortness of breath, persistent cough, and phlegm, but significantly lower odds of phlegm, forgetfulness, and burns. With deforestation and population pressures increasing reliance on low-quality biomass fuels, prevalence of HAPrelated cardiopulmonary and neurologic symptoms will likely increase among cooks. Short- to medium-term strategies are needed to secure access to high-quality biomass fuels given limited potential for scalable transitions to modern energy.},

  abstract = {Open burning of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a poorly-characterized and frequently-underestimated source of air pollution in developing countries. This paper estimates the quantity of MSW that was burned in five erstwhile municipalities of the Kathmandu valley, Nepal. A household survey, a transect walk survey, an experiment to measure the fraction of waste that is combustible, a survey on fraction of population burning waste outside their houses, and a survey of the fraction of MSW burned at dump sites were performed in this study, whereas burning/oxidation efficiency, municipal populations, MSW generation rates, and emission factors were derived from the literature. The total mass of MSW burned during 2016 is estimated to be 7400 tons (i.e., 20 tons/day), which was of 3\% of the total MSW generated in the valley municipalities that year. This exceeds Government estimates by a factor of three. Multiplying the burned MSW mass by emission factors, the air pollutant emissions are estimated as PM2.5 55 tons (OC 42 tons and EC 1.4 tons), PM10 60 tons, BC 25 tons, CO2 11,900 tons, CH4 30 tons, SO2 5.0 tons, NOx 19.2 tons, CO 630 tons, NMVOC 112 tons, and NH3 5.7 tons per year. Open burning of MSW can trigger health impacts such as acute and chronic respiratory disease, heart diseases, and allergic hypersensitivity, in addition to impacts on local climate. Improved waste-segregation practices at the source and waste-collection systems throughout the valley are needed to mitigate this pollution source and its effects.},

We also review the research predicting gender ideology, focusing on social and demographic characteristics while concurrently examining studies using cross-sectional, trend, and panel data. Finally, this article summarizes research focused on the consequences of gender ideology, both in families and family-related behaviors and in other areas of social life where beliefs about gender are relevant, such as the workplace.

We exploit the fact that some beneficiaries who received transfers did not receive the forms needed to monitor the attendance of their children at school. We use a variety of techniques, including nearest neighbor matching and household fixed effects regressions, to show that the absence of these forms reduced the likelihood that children attended school with this effect most pronounced when children are transitioning to lower secondary school.

Authorities have embraced waste-to-energy incinerators, and wastepickers fear that these changes threaten their access to waste, while middle class residents oppose them because of their deleterious impact on ambient air quality. We narrate the emergence of an unlikely alliance between these groups, whose politics opposes the production of a waste-based commodity frontier within the city. We conclude that the materiality and political economy of cities are co-constituted, and contestations over the (re)configuration of urban metabolisms span these spheres as people struggle to realize situated urban political ecologies.},

In this study, year-round light-absorption observations were conducted during 2014 using an aethalometer in Xiamen, a coastal city in Southeast China. Source apportionment of BC was performed and temporal variations in BC sources were characterized based on both light absorption measurements and a source-oriented air quality model.

A sensitivity analysis was performed with different absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent (AAE) values of fossil fuel combustion (\emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{ff}) and biomass burning (\emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{bb}), suggesting that the aethalometer method was more sensitive to changes in \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{bb} than \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{ff}. BC\textsubscript{bb} contribution exhibited a clear diurnal cycle, with the highest level (37.9\&thinsp;\%) in the evening rush hour and a seasonal pattern with the maximum (39.9\&thinsp;\%) in winter. Conditional probability function (CPF) analysis revealed the large biomass-burning contributions were accompanied by east-northeasterly and northerly winds. Backward trajectory indicated that air masses from North and East\textendash Central China were associated with larger biomass-burning contributions. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) suggested that North and East\textendash Central China and Southeast Asia were potential sources of both BC\textsubscript{ff} and BC\textsubscript{bb}. The source-oriented modeling results showed that transportation, residential and open biomass burning accounting for 45.3\&thinsp;\%, 30.1\&thinsp;\% and 17.6\&thinsp;\% were the major BC sources. Among the three fuel catalogs, liquid fossil fuel (46.5\&thinsp;\%) was the largest source, followed by biomass burning (32.6\&thinsp;\%) and coal combustion (20.9\&thinsp;\%). Source contributions of fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning identified by the source-oriented model were 67.4\&thinsp;\% and 32.6\&thinsp;\%, respectively, close to those obtained by the aethalometer method. The findings provide solid support for controlling fossil fuel sources to limit the impacts of BC on climate change and environmental degradation in the relatively clean region in China.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Since the 1990s, the conversion of land for urban use has never been more intense. Occurring under all latitudes, transcending the economic disparities as well as the political regimes, urban built-up expansion appears very much articulated to the global financial turn, which occurred after the progressive destatization of the money creation, which accelerated and globalized after the debt crisis of the 1980s. Using the Global Human Settlement Layer dataset on the degree of urbanization, we can assess that, worldwide, the built-up surface expanded by 243,000~km2 between 1990 and 2015 and the average urban density has declined slightly from 2775 inhabitants per km2 to 2756. After describing the national level dataset used and our methodology, we expose the regional nuances in the global built-up spreading and their relations to population growth. Then in a third section, we correlate those national trends with a set of significant economic indicators. We articulate it also to the individualization and progress of housing condition. Population growth remains the dominant factor determining urban built-up spread, but countries differ. Built-up growth did not respond linearly to the final demand for housing and therefore to demographic pressure. Building is a material good whose value is also interdependent with economic growth. The universal relationship between size and density specific to scaling laws is verified once again in the case of cities. However, economic density or concentration of wealth tends to take precedence over population mass to explain urban built-up expansion.},

  abstract = {This manuscript provides an overview of the legislative requirements for the use of mechanical recycled plastics in articles placed on the EU market, as seen from the perspective of a plastics recycler. The first part reviews the main principles included in the overarching legislation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restrictions of Chemicals (REACH) and to what extent these are applicable for mechanical recyclers of plastics. The interactions between REACH and the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) is discussed, as well as the difficulties for recyclers to comply with certain REACH requirements. In a second part, the focus is moved to the use of recycled plastics as Food Contact Material (FCM). The scope of the different applicable EU FCM regulations is inventorised as well as the key legislative principles involved. A final section is dedicated to the discussion on the authorisation of recycling processes under the FCM regulation and the practical challenges involved for the effective introduction of FCMs containing recycled plastics. Altogether it could be concluded that the complexity of the different legal perspectives, a lack of communication and transparency within the plastic value chain together with technical challenges related to recycling processes have been hindering the effective uptake of recycled plastic FCM (with the exception for bottle PET). The development of targeted solutions across the entire value-chain, taking into account different perspectives in terms of legislation and health protection, economic growth and technical innovations, will be crucial in achieving a circular economy for plastics, including recycled plastics for FCM.},

  abstract = {The slow pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was investigated over a range of final temperatures from 410\,\textdegree C to 480\,\textdegree C yielding a wide variety of species. The objective of the current study was to provide thermal dependent evolution profile for mass loss and pyrolysis gas, in addition to the partial quantification of the waxy products. The polymer degradation was first characterized by thermogravimetric analysis. Many parameters were studied such as final temperature, heating rate, flow rate and the presence or not of a lid on the crucible. The slow pyrolysis of PET was then performed in a horizontal tubular reactor at 5\,\textdegree C/min. The pyrolysis products were analysed, focusing especially on gaseous and waxy fractions. The gas emitted was monitored online by {$\mu$}-GC which allowed establishing their real time evolution profile. Carbonyl species were analyzed using HPLC. As a result, the gas contained mainly acetaldehyde, CO and CO2, and to a smaller extent ethylene and benzene. Benzene profile exhibited two peaks, indicating that there may be two steps or two main reactions in the release of this compound. The waxy products were characterized by GC/MS-FID and FTIR techniques. FTIR showed that the main chemical moieties of the waxy products were carboxylic acids and esters. GC/MS-FID confirmed that these pyrolysates contained mainly benzoic acid and its derivatives and monovinyl terephthalate. The quantitative analysis showed that the highest production of benzoic acid was obtained at 430\,\textdegree C. Its yield is 11\% of initial PET mass.},

This paper argues for the re-conceptualization of solid waste management systems that integrate waste pickers as partners, as key to building just, inclusive and livable cities for all. It also presents a specific model in which informal waste workers are integrated as key stakeholders as one example of best practice in this area, thus contributing to current discussions on integrated and inclusive solid waste models.},

  abstract = {Efficient packaging waste management systems are essential considering recent revisions of the European legislation on packaging waste management that sets ambitious targets. European rules aim to deal with the increasing quantities of packaging waste, which cause environmental problems. Consequently, it is necessary to identify functional packaging waste management systems to achieve these targets effectively and efficiently. However, given the heterogeneity of the different packaging management systems, policymakers, scholars, and industry operators struggle to have a comparative view. The number of non-harmonized laws in force across countries, autonomous recycling targets, and constant updates are prominent problems that make it difficult to obtain comparable information for research, business, and policymaking. To fill this gap, our research question consists of assigning responsibilities for prevention, collection, recycling, and recovery and an overview of some models at a glance with respect to the general governance and functioning of the system. We base our research on a multiple-case design since more cases are examined using complementary data collection methods, analysis of the previous literature, reports, legislation, and business and institutional websites. Our results provide insights from the following cases: Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Spain, and Italy. In addition, policy implications emerge as our insights help overcome barriers in the European market's development caused by the different rules on packaging management and design serving policymakers that aim to harmonize the management of packaging waste. The paper also contains managerial implications for circular economy business models that can be used by managers who aim to design or upgrade their business models according to both recent legislative upgrades and packaging management systems.},

The paper suggests that multiple markets imply multiple prices, which are contingent and contested. When dealing with price mechanisms largely outside their control, actors tend to associate a fair price with the going market price, rather than factors such as state regulation. Approaches to morality and assessments of fairness become more ambiguous when prices are mediated by actors' own practices. These range from gift relations to paternalism, envy and deception.},

  abstract = {``Waste-to-energy'' (WTE) technologies have been presented as one of the avenues to improve the management of solid waste whilst promoting clean and healthy urban environments through the recovery of waste and generation of energy. Research suggests that with the right investment in technologies and institutional changes, waste can potentially become a resource that can contribute to the socio-economic development of cities. It is in this context that this paper presents a review of the literature on WTE technologies and their implications on sustainable waste management in urban areas. The paper particularly contributes to our understanding of WTE technologies and its potential on Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) in Johannesburg, South Africa. It is estimated that the city of Johannesburg's landfills airspace will be completely depleted by year 2023. This projection becomes a motivation for the identification of suitable WTE alternative avenues to manage waste in the city. The paper argues that WTE technologies can contribute significantly to sustainable waste management, economic growth, ecological and environmental well-being.},

  abstract = {The treatment of source-separated biowaste is still a challenge due to its high proportion of impurities. Biowaste bins are intended exclusively for the collection of biodegradable matter, such as food, kitchen and garden waste. However, plastics, metals, glass and textiles are also found in biowaste bins. If not properly removed, these impurities cause problems to the treatment facility and depreciate the quality of the final product, when the biowaste is converted to compost. There is ongoing discussion whether the existing treatment systems are able to remove impurities, especially plastics, from biowaste thoroughly enough to ensure that the produced compost complies with state regulations. In this work, two wet mechanical pre-treatment systems were tested for their efficiency to remove impurities. The first system consisted of a screw mill, a star screen, and a food unpacking machine (process I). The second system consisted of a shredder, followed by a piston press with 12\,mm pore size (process II). Both processes produced a dry output, which contained the concentrated impurities, and a wet output, which could be used as substrate for anaerobic digestion. Results showed that, although 99\% of the incoming plastics were efficiently removed in process I, the impurities concentration was still too high to meet the legal standards of plastics concentration in the final product, according to the German Federal Compost Quality Association (Bundesg\"utegemeinschaft Kompost e.V.). The removal efficiency of glass particles was low for both processes: at least 80\% of the incoming particles were transferred to the wet output.},

We find that on average WTP decreases by nearly one-fourth when allocating respondents time to think but markedly increases when we use a `ballot box' approach allowing respondents to state their willingness privately. Our results suggest that on average households are willing to pay US\$0.42 per month (0.2 per cent of household annual income). We conclude that total citywide benefits are unlikely to exceed the costs of implementing such a program at this point, although this situation may change quickly with increasing economic growth.},

  abstract = {Real time measurements of Black Carbon (BC) in PM2.5 aerosols were performed during AMMA and POLCA programs, between 2005 and 2010 in Cotonou (Benin), Dakar (Senegal), Bamako (Mali), and Yaounde (Cameroon). Indeed, BC was chosen as a metric because of its interest as an urban pollutant. The instrumented sites are representative of the traffic source. At Dakar, BC concentrations are high from November to April (13,000 \AE{} 3500 ng m\`A3) and lower from May to September (8000 \AE{} 3200 ng m\`A3). In dry season (NovembereApril), high BC concentrations occurred as a result of northeasterly long-range transport of polluted air masses over West Africa, in addition to local emissions. However, during wet season (MayeSeptember) reduced traffic levels, school vacations and wet deposition processes contribute to lower BC concentration levels. Measured diurnal BC peak concentrations, at all sites, mainly occur during morning and evening rush-hour periods, indicating the paramount role of traffic. Highest values are observed between 5e9 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. depending on the site, while lowest are occurred at night time and middle afternoon when activities of the population are reduced. BC source apportionment from absorption measurements also confirmed the relative importance of traffic (88\%) versus biomass burning (12\%). Also, BC measurements were functions of days of the week, with highest values occurring on Fridays and lowest ones on Sundays. Spatial variations associated to BC levels are very different from one site to another, revealing different types of sources with strong variations at the regional scale. It appears that mean BC concentrations in Dakar are lower by a factor of two, compared to those observed in Bamako, but remain higher than in some other West African sites (e.g. Cotonou, Yaounde). Overall, BC concentrations in our different sites are comparable to reported European and Asian megacity levels. Finally, using measured BC/PM2.5 ratios, we have estimated PM2.5 mass concentrations in Dakar from June 2008 to June 2009 to be 44.4 \AE{} 14.3 mg m\`A3, well above the WHO (2005) threshold of 10 mg m\`A3. This paper clearly highlights high pollution levels in West African large cities, with potential important impacts on the health of the regional population.},

All public health institutions inside Jigjiga town were included and the study participants were randomly selected from each health facility. Data were collected using pre-tested and self administered questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with knowledge and practice of health workers. Out of those involved in this study, 47.7\% and 42.3\% of respondents had good knowledge and good practice on healthcare waste management, respectively. Health workers in the age group of 35\textendash 44 years, nurses, midwifes, medical laboratory, were significantly associated with knowledge of health workers. On the other hand, only educational status was significantly associated with practice. In this study, both knowledge and practice of health workers about healthcare waste management was poor. To enhance both the knowledge and practice of health workers, on job training is recommended.}

  abstract = {Air pollution primarily originates from substances that are directly emitted from natural or anthropogenic processes, such as carbon monoxide (CO) gas emitted in vehicle exhaust or sulfur dioxide (SO2) released from factories. However, a major air pollution problem is particulate matter (PM), which is an adverse effect of wildfires and open burning. Application tools for air pollution monitoring in risk areas using real-time monitoring with drones have emerged. A new air quality index (AQI) for monitoring and display, such as three-dimensional (3D) mapping based on data assessment, is essential for timely environmental surveying. The objective of this paper is to present a 3D AQI mapping data assessment using a hybrid model based on a machine-learning method for drone real-time air pollution monitoring (Dr-TAPM). Dr-TAPM was designed by equipping drones with multi-environmental sensors for carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5,10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), with data pre- and post-processing with the hybrid model. The hybrid model for data assessment was proposed using backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. Experimentally, we considered a case study detecting smoke emissions from an open burning scenario. As a result, PM2.5,10 and CO were detected as air pollutants from open burning. 3D AQI map locations were shown and the validation learning rates were apparent, as the accuracy of predicted AQI data assessment was 98\%.},

  abstract = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice., To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension., We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections: , , The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques., To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique., Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost students' performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading)., Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research.},

That said, the transition to a sustainable plastics system requires an integrated, knowledge-based systems approach that interrogates the dynamics and causal-effect relationships of the interconnected challenges.

  abstract = {Composted Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) is used in agricultural soils as a source of organic matter and nutrients. Besides, its use avoids landfilling or incineration following the principles of circular economy. It is well established that source separated OFMSW is suitable for compost production, but its quality depends on their content in non-compostable materials. In this work, we selected and studied the final refined compost form five OFMSW facilities over a five-month period. The plants displayed differences in collection systems, concentration on non-desired materials, treatment technology and density of served population. The presence of plastic was studied using a separation and identification process that consisted of oxidation and flotation followed by spectroscopic identification. The results showed a concentration of plastic impurities in the 10\textendash 30 items/g of dry compost range. The concentration of small fragments and fibres (equivalent diameter~{$<~$}5~mm) was in the 5\textendash 20 items/g of dry weight range and were dominated by fibres (25\% of all particles {$<$}500~{$\mu$}m). Five polymers represented 94\% of the plastic items: polyethylene, polystyrene, polyester, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and acrylic polymers in order of abundance. Polyethylene was more abundant in films, polystyrene in fragments, polypropylene in filaments, and fibres were dominated by polyester. Our results showed that smaller plants, with OFMSW door-to-door collection systems produced compost with less plastic of all sizes. Compost from big facilities fed by OFMSW from street bin collection displayed the highest contents of plastics. No debris from compostable bioplastics were found in any of the samples, meaning that if correctly composted their current use does not contribute to the spreading of anthropogenic pollution. Our results suggested that the use of compostable polymers and the implementation of door-to-door collection systems could reduce the concentration of plastic impurities in compost from OFMSW.},

The flakes are coated with a sodium or potassium hydroxide solution, heated, then dried before being further heated in a continuous rotary reactor to a high temperature with a counter flow of air. The recycled flakes are intended to be used at up to 100\% for the manufacture of new food packaging materials and articles, typically bottles and thermoformed sheets. These recycled materials and articles are intended to be used in direct contact with all kind of foodstuffs for long term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill. The dossier does not satisfy the requirements of the EFSA guidelines. In particular, the Panel was unable to derive an adequate description and understanding of the main steps and the operating parameters of the technology. Furthermore, the Panel considered the challenge tests as not suitable for demonstrating the required cleaning efficiency of the process. Despite a request for clarification, fundamental issues were not satisfactorily addressed. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the process URRC Veolia is not adequately characterised.

The principle of the evaluation is to apply the cleaning efficiency of a recycling technology or process, obtained from a challenge test with surrogate contaminants, to a reference contamination level for post consumer PET, conservatively set a 3 mg/kg PET for a contaminant resulting from possible misuse. The resulting residual concentration of each contaminant in recycled PET (Cres) is then compared to a modelled concentration in PET (Cmod). This Cmod is calculated using generally recognized conservative migration models such that the related migration does not give rise to a dietary exposure exceeding 0.0025 {$\mu$}g/kg bw/day, the human exposure threshold value for chemicals with structural alerts raising concern for potential genotoxicity, below which the risk to human health would be negligible. The default scenario, when the recycled PET is intended for general use, is that of an infant weighing 5 kg and consuming every day 0.75 l of water coming from a water bottle manufactured from 100\% recycled PET. According to this scenario, it can be derived that the highest concentration of a substance in water that would ensure that the dietary exposure of 0.0025 \textmu g/kg bw/day is not exceeded, is 0.017 {$\mu$}g/kg food. Taking into account that generally agreed diffusion modelling overestimates migration by at least 5 times, a calculated migration less than 0.1 \textmu g/kg in food would satisfy the above criterion for the default exposure scenario. In the case of the other exposure scenarios for adults and toddlers, the relevant migration criterion will accordingly be 0.75 and 0.15 \textmu g/kg food. Therefore if a recycling process is able to reduce an input reference contamination of 3 mg/kg PET to a Cres not higher than a Cmod corresponding to the relevant migration criterion, the potential dietary exposure cannot be higher than 0.0025 \textmu g/kg bw/day and recycled PET manufactured with such recycling process is not considered of safety concern. The Panel considered appropriate that the proportion of PET from non-food consumer applications should be no more than 5\% in the input to be recycled.},

These processes are used to recycle post-consumer high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles which have been in contact with food, mainly milk, to produce recycled HDPE pellets. Post-consumer HDPE bottles are collected in the United Kingdom and processed by conventional recycling including manual sorting into washed and dried HDPE flakes containing no more than 1 \% HDPE from non-food consumer applications. The washed and dried HDPE flakes are heated in two successive continuous reactors under vacuum before being extruded under vacuum into pellets. Recycled pellets are blended with virgin HDPE to produce bottles (both processes) and with virgin polypropylene to produce trays (Biffa Polymers). Bottles are intended for storage of milk and fruit juices. Trays are intended for storage of animal products and raw fruits, vegetables and mushrooms. Having examined the challenge tests provided, the Panel noted the limited decontamination efficiency under the conditions of testing and concluded that the processes do not satisfy criteria set for HDPE. Uncertainties and consequent conservatism of the selected criteria could allow the conclusion that a process is safe when these criteria are met but not when they are not met. Therefore, the CEF Panel considered that, for the manufacture of recycled bottles for milks and fruit juices and trays for animal products, additional data should be provided before it can conclude on the safety assessment. For the manufacture of recycled trays intended for contact with whole fruits and vegetables including mushrooms, at room temperature or below, the CEF Panel concluded that recycled HDPE obtained from the process Biffa Polymers is not considered of safety concern under the restriction given in the opinion.},

Neo-Malthusian, modernization, and dependency theories are applied in a cross-national comparison of 51 developing countries. Multiple regression techniques are applied to estimate the rate of deforestation using the level of urbanization, economic growth rate, population growth rate, level of sectoral inequality, rate of change in primary product exports, and rate of change in tertiary education. Results support modernization theory, indicating that the level of urbanization has a curvilinear effect on the rate of deforestation, that economic growth contributes to deforestation, and that sectoral inequality reduces the rate of deforestation. In support of neo-Malthusian theory, population growth results in higher rates of deforestation. Tertiary education has a mild negative effect on the rate of deforestation, whereas the effect of trade dependency is insignificant.},

  abstract = {Earth has been a traditional construction material to build houses in Africa. One of the most common earthen masonry techniques is the use of sun dried or kiln fired adobe bricks with mud mortar. Although this technique is cheap and allows the self construction, the bricks vary largely in shape, strength and durability. This has lead historically to weak houses which suffer considerable damage during floods and seismic events. Furthermore, the use of firewood kilns to burn bricks has caused extensive deforestation in several countries of Africa. A solution which has been proposed in the second half of the last century is the use of stabilised compressed earth blocks (CEBs). These blocks are manufactured by compacting stabilised earth in a manual or hydraulic press. The resulting blocks present higher values of strength and durability, as well as uniform shapes. Since earth is available almost in every location of the world, the CEBs can be produced in-situ. The fact that this blocks are unburned and that the transport can be omitted makes them a cheap material with very low embodied energy. Their use is a cost effective opportunity for locals to have better houses while reducing deforestation. In this context one developed an ongoing study for the manufacture of CEBs according to different materials available in Malawi. It is envisaged that the constructive solution with the proposed CEBs will enable improvements in durability, in thermal and acoustic comfort and in seismic behaviour of buildings in Malawi, where earth is an abundant material and labour is unskilled. This paper presents some results of the experimental campaign which has been carried out. For this purpose, soils from Malawi were characterized and tested without stabilization, as well as with cement and/or lime addition.},

Indonesia has the third highest number of people of any country in the world without access to sanitation and, like most developing countries, it is devoting insufficient resources to the issue. In rural areas, rather than providing additional funding, the government \textemdash with support of the World Bank \textemdash{} has promoted the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach, which uses social mobilization to encourage people to construct their own latrines. In Indonesia as elsewhere, CLTS involves more than just education and encouragement; it uses social shaming and punishments. The authors argue that this is not only an inadequate approach but one which echoes coercive, race-based colonial public health practices. This article thus integrates extant historiography on Indonesian colonial medicine with contemporary scholarly literature and field research on CLTS using case studies of a 1920s hookworm-eradication programme funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, and the current World Bank Water and Sanitation Programme, both in Java.},

  abstract = {Plastic recycling is promoted in the transition toward a circular economy and a closed plastic loop, typically using mass-based recycling targets. Plastic from household waste (HHW) is contaminated and heterogeneous, and recycled plastic from HHW often has a limited application range, due to reduced quality. To correctly assess the ability to close plastic loops via recycling, both plastic quantities and qualities need to be evaluated. This study defines a circularity potential representing the ability of a recovery system to close material loops assuming steady-state market conditions. Based on an average plastic waste composition including impurities, 84 recovery scenarios representing a wide range of sorting schemes, source-separation efficiencies, and material recovery facility (MRF) configurations and performances were assessed. The qualities of the recovered fractions were assessed based on contamination and the circularity potential calculated for each scenario in a European context. Across all scenarios, 17\% to 100\% of the generated plastic mass could be recovered, with higher source-separation and MRF efficiencies leading to higher recovery. Including quality, however, at best 55\% of the generated plastic was suitable for recycling due to contamination. Source-separation, a high number of target fractions, and efficient MRF recovery were found to be critical. The circularity potential illustrated that less than 42\% of the plastic loop can be closed with current technology and raw material demands. Hence, Europe is still far from able to close the plastic loop. When transitioning toward a circular economy, the focus should be on limiting impurities and losses through product design, technology improvement, and more targeted plastic waste management.},

The impact of water supply and sanitation on diarrhoea, related infections, nutritional status, and mortality is analysed by reviewing 67 studies from 28 countries. The median reductions in diarrhoea morbidity rates are 22\% from all studies and 27\% from a few better-designed studies. All studies of the impact on total mortality rates show a median reduction of 21\%, while the few better-designed studies give a median reduction of 30\%. Improvements in water quality have less of an impact than improvements in water availability or excreta disposal.},

  abstract = {This research investigated the possibility of transferring phosphorus from human urine into a concentrated form that can be used as fertilizer in agriculture. The community of Siddhipur in Nepal was chosen as a research site, because there is a strong presence and acceptance of the urine-diverting dry toilets needed to collect urine separately at the source. Furthermore, because the mainly agricultural country is landlocked and depends on expensive, imported fertilizers, the need for nutrient security is high. We found that struvite (MgNH4PO4{$\cdot$}6H2O) precipitation from urine is an efficient and simple approach to produce a granulated phosphorus fertilizer. Bittern, a waste stream from salt production, is a practical magnesium source for struvite production, but it has to be imported from India. Calculations show that magnesium oxide produced from locally available magnesite would be a cheaper magnesium source. A reactor with an external filtration system was capable of removing over 90\% of phosphorus with a low magnesium dosage (1.1 mol Mg mol P), with coarse nylon filters (pore width up to 160 {$\pm$} 50 {$\mu$}m) and with only one hour total treatment time. A second reactor setup based on sedimentation only achieved 50\% phosphate removal, even when flocculants were added. Given the current fertilizer prices, high volumes of urine must be processed, if struvite recovery should be financially sustainable. Therefore, it is important to optimize the process. Our calculations showed that collecting the struvite and calcium phosphate precipitated spontaneously due to urea hydrolysis could increase the overall phosphate recovery by at least 40\%. The magnesium dosage can be optimized by estimating the phosphate concentration by measuring electrical conductivity. An important source of additional revenue could be the effluent of the struvite reactor. Further research should be aimed at finding methods and technologies to recover the nutrients from the effluent.},

Notwithstanding, such practices also make waste materials readily available for itinerant waste pickers. These `scavengers' as they are called, therefore perceive waste as a resource, for income generation. Literature suggests that Informal Sector Recycling (ISR) activity can bring other benefits such as, economic growth, litter control and resources conservation. This paper critically reviews trends in ISR activities in selected developing and transition countries. ISR often survives in very hostile social and physical environments largely because of negative Government and public attitude. Rather than being stigmatised, the sector should be recognised as an important element for achievement of sustainable waste management in developing countries. One solution to this problem could be the integration of ISR into the formal waste management system. To achieve ISR integration, this paper highlights six crucial aspects from literature: social acceptance, political will, mobilisation of cooperatives, partnerships with private enterprises, management and technical skills, as well as legal protection measures. It is important to note that not every country will have the wherewithal to achieve social inclusion and so the level of integration must be `flexible'. In addition, the structure of the ISR should not be based on a `universal' model but should instead take into account local contexts and conditions.},

Simple use of these devices can offer the prospect of more timely data entry and greater accuracy in guiding respondents through skip patterns. Further benefits are possible through the use of more complex consistency checks. We use PDAs to measure sales and profits for microenterprises, which are notoriously noisy. Consistency checks in the cross-section compare sales and profits, while those in the panel query responses which result in large changes from one period to the next. Cross-sectional checks also served as a second prompt in the case of missing profits. These checks do succeed in reducing the standard deviation and in increasing the correlation of the observations for which corrections are made. However, we find that the vast majority of large changes in enterprise sales and profits are confirmed by firm owners as genuine, highlighting the volatility of income in this sector. As a result, the overall impact of these consistency checks on the full sample is rather limited, suggesting that while such checks are useful if computerized forms of data collection are being used, the consistency checks per se are not a strong reason for using computerized data collection in collecting firm profits and sales.},

They are simple to build but require periodic emptying which results in widespread dispersion of fecal pathogens in the environment. While much is known about the health risks of fecal-oral exposure, little is known about those resulting from the aerosolization of pathogens from fecal material. Bioaerosols were sampled around seven pit latrines before, after, and during emptying in Blantyre, Malawi. Bioaerosols were collected directly onto nutrient and selective medium agar plates using an impact sampler. DNA was extracted from some plates and analyzed for selected enteric pathogens. Total heterotrophic bacteria in the air during active emptying ranged from 198 to N13,000 colony forming units (CFU) per m3, and generally increased above background levels during pit emptying. At about one meter from the pit latrine emptying, E. coli and total coliforms concentrations in air reached up to 350 and 790 CFU m-3, respectively. Additionally, at four out of the seven pit latrines sites sampled, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) LT/ST was confirmed to be present in bioaerosols. This work demonstrates the potential for airborne dispersion of enteric pathogens during pit latrine emptying operations.},

  abstract = {A variety of low-cost sensors are now available on the consumer market for measuring air pollutants. The use of these low-cost sensors for ambient air monitoring applications is increasing and includes fence-line or nearsource monitoring, community monitoring, emergency response, hot-spot identification, mobile monitoring, epidemiological studies, and supplemental monitoring to improve the spatial-temporal resolution of current monitoring networks. Evaluating and understanding the performance of these devices is necessary to properly interpret the results and reduce confusion when low-cost sensor measurements are not in agreement with measurements from regulatory-grade instrumentation. Systematic and comprehensive field and laboratory studies comparing low-cost sensors with regulatory-grade instrumentation are necessary to characterize sensor performance. This paper presents the results of 12 particulate matter (PM) sensors measurement of PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 {$\mu$}m) tested under ambient conditions against a federally equivalent method (FEM) instrument at an ambient air monitoring station in Riverside, CA spanning over a 3year period from 02/05/15 to 03/27/18. Sensors were evaluated in triplicate with a typical time duration of 8week. Performance evaluation results found 6 of the 12 sensor triplicates with average R2 values {$\geq$} 0.70 for PM2.5 concentrations less than 50 {$\mu$}g/m3. Within this subset, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ranged from 4.4 to 7.0 {$\mu$}g/m3 indicating the need for caution when interpreting data from these sensors. Additional analysis revealed that the impact of relative humidity on sensor performance varied between models with several models exhibiting increased bias error with increasing humidity. Results indicate that a number of these sensors have potential as useful tools for characterizing PM2.5 levels in ambient environments when data is interpreted and understood correctly with regard to existing ambient air quality networks. The performance evaluation results are specific for Riverside, CA under non-repeatable ambient weather conditions and particle properties with the expectation that performance evaluation testing at other locations with different particle properties and weather conditions would yield similar but non-identical results.},

Domestic recyclable resources (DRR) are the recyclable part of the household waste, and are recycled mainly by informal systems in many developing countries. The recycling system in China is a typical example which exist in formal and informal recycling systems simultaneously. Based on filed research, questionnaire survey and interview, this paper carefully studies the recycling paths, material flows and cash flows in the informal recycling system in Suzhou urban area, and aims to give targeted policy suggestions in the framework of Pressure\textendash State\textendash Response (PSR) model. Based on the result, the recycling rate in Suzhou urban area was about 22\% in 2013. It is suggested for the government to integrate the informal recycling system into municipal solid waste management by (1) giving professional training of the recycling practitioners and improving their recycling facilities, (2) giving the formal recycling channels a price advantage, (3) setting up information platforms, and (4) optimizing the layouts of recycling systems. These quantitate results and policy suggestions could be helpful to integrate the informal recycling system into municipal solid waste management of the formal recycling systems.},

The feasibility of the allocation of MSW material recovery facilities (MRF) as intermediate points between the generators of these wastes and the options for reuse and disposal was evaluated, as well as the participation of associations and cooperatives of waste pickers. This network was mathematically modelled and validated through a scenario analysis of the municipality of S\~ao Mateus, which makes the location model more complete and applicable in practice. The mathematical model allows the determination of the number of facilities required for the reverse logistics network, their location, capacities, and product flows between these facilities. The fixed costs of installation and operation of the proposed MRF were balanced with the reduction of transport costs, allowing the inclusion of waste pickers to the reverse logistics network. The main contribution of this study lies in the proposition of a reverse logistics network for MSW simultaneously involving legal, environmental, economic and social criteria, which is a very complex goal. This study can guide practices in other countries that have realities similar to those in Brazil of accelerated urbanisation without adequate planning for solid waste management, added to the strong presence of waste pickers that, through the characteristic of social vulnerability, must be included in the system. In addition to the theoretical contribution to the reverse logistics network problem, this study aids in decision-making for public managers who have limited technical and administrative capacities for the management of solid wastes.},

The objective of the paper is to suggest a multidimensional approach, both quantitative and qualitative, for planning sustainable waste management systems in areas with no data availability. The research assessed six different long-term management plans, considering all recycling settings feasible for La Paz. For that purpose, a multi-criteria decision analysis has been introduced, supported by environmental and financial impact assessment concerning transportation, final disposal, and material recovery. Results suggest that the inclusion of the informal sector could be the most feasible option from an economic and technological point of view. Moreover, the curbside collection of organic waste could be considered the best solution for reducing the global warming potential and for improving the useful life of the sanitary landfill. The approach introduced, as well as the combination of solutions evaluated, could be of interest for stakeholders of Latin America for reducing environmental impacts and introducing a new business. Though the multi-criteria decision analysis and the impact-assessment do not provide a dynamic view of future scenarios, their combination could offer a first integrated insight into the possible challenges and opportunities for developing a new municipal solid waste management system in developing cities, encouraging the circular economy and sustainable development.},

The use of geographic information system (GIS) is appropriated for obtaining reliable data about SC yields and management costs. However, in low-middle income countries, advanced assessments are difficult to introduce due to the lack of technical knowledge, financial support and the presence of the informal recycling sector. This research aims to assess the main potentialities of the introduction of SC systems in a Bolivian developing city taking into account the informal SC system in place. The study was conducted with QGIS3.8 software in order to evaluate the main advantages of the implementation of formal and informal recycling chains. Results reported that, comparing the implementation of formal SC of MSW with the scenario that considered the inclusion of the informal recycling, the activity of waste pickers allows reducing the expenses of about 10\%, increasing the recycling rate of about 3.5\%, and reducing the distances traveled with compactor trucks of about 7\%. It means that, the annual path traveled by the collection trucks for gathering about 16,000ty-1, is reduced by 2734kmy-1, reducing the waste disposed to landfill of about 543.6ty-1 and the expenses of about \texteuro 59,000 per year. The presentation of these results to policy-makers can support decision-making boosting the implementation of recycling activities including waste pickers.

The analysis of the management system (2019) is compared with future developments in recycling that counts with the support of an international cooperative project financed by the Italian cooperation. Results reported that, at a municipal level, CDW mismanagement contributes more than 60\% to the freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, which represents the most relevant impact generated by this waste stream. Recycling allows achieving avoided impacts higher than the ones produced for three of six environmental impacts, suggesting MSW and CDW recovery as an important option for preventing environmental degradation. The research is the first attempt to highlight the importance of organizing appropriate CDW management systems into an integrated waste management scheme for mitigating environmental impacts in developing cities.},

  abstract = {The implementation of waste selective collection (SC) schemes in low-income countries is a challenge although it is one important way for improving environmental sustainability. The inclusion of the population is necessary for gaining effective results, and social surveys are support methods for understanding citizens? involvement and behaviour. The aim of the research is to assess the support of the citizens concerning the formal and informal recycling in a low?middle income country. The study presents a questionnaire survey conducted in 2018 in La Paz, Bolivia, where 774 citizens were interviewed for evaluating their support to the formal and informal SC systems. Two questionnaires were submitted to two different users? categories: users of the formal recyclable waste gathering points; and citizens of the neighbourhoods. Evidence of the survey shows that about 8\% of the population supports the formal SC while about 48\% are used to selecting their waste at home. About 79.2\% of them bring the waste to the informal recycling shops or provide it to waste pickers, throwing the waste into or nearby the mixed containers in order to facilitate their collection. This research demonstrates how social inclusion is important for planning recycling systems within a developing big city, starting from the SC. Results suggest that the informal sector can be an effective means for improving the recycling behaviour of the citizens. The study can be of interest to stakeholders involved in introducing recycling policies in developing cities where the SC rate is still low, and informal waste collection exists.},

Indeed, response to follow-up valuation questions may be influenced by the bid proposed in the initial valuation question. Previous researches have been conducted in order to control for such an effect. However, they find that efficiency gains are lost when we control for undesirable response effects, relative to a single dichotomous choice question. Contrary to these results, we propose a way to control for starting-point bias in double-bounded questions with gains in efficiency. (JEL C35, Q26)},

This paper contributes to this goal by providing a systematic review of research, published in English between 2015 and 2020, on drivers and barriers of consumers' plastic packaging waste avoidance and recycling in private households. Focus is specifically on economically developed countries because they are responsible for the biggest share of plastic packaging waste and have implemented the most advanced and ambiguous legislation and regulation for plastic packaging waste prevention and recycling. Based on a search in Scopus, 36 peer-reviewed articles were identified that empirically address what motivates consumers to engage in these activities and what difficulties and hindrances they experience for doing so in an effective way. According to this research, the most important drivers of consumers' plastic packaging waste avoidance and recycling are environmental concern and task-specific benefits, and the most important barriers are lack of knowledge and understanding as well as lack of opportunities, inconvenience, and task difficulty. Moreover, there is some evidence that plastic packaging waste avoidance and recycling behaviours are interlinked, contingent on shared motives and understanding, which calls for an integrated approach considering potential positive and negative spill-over between plastic packaging waste behaviours.},

As they crisscrossed daily the city?s neighborhoods gathering paper, plastic and other recyclable materials, these socially stigmatized, politically disenfranchised and economically pauperized scavengers practiced civility from below with many neighborhood residents from all walks of life in civil society and, occasionally, with municipal officials and members of one or another environmental NGO and waste disposal company in political society. In dialogue with Norbert Elias?s and Cheshire Calhoun?s accounts of liberal civility, and Etienne Balibar?s revisionist conception of radical civility, my study discusses them from the perspective of Buenos Aires? waste pickers.},

Although Blockchain has become known for its support of crypto-coins (or crypto currencies), especially Bitcoin, its scope has become much larger, including businesses of relevant social impact. This paper presents an application of the Ethereum's Blockchain digital architecture for the solid waste management in a small municipality in the State of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil. This application comes to replace a paper-based current system. The current system uses printed cards called Green Coins, presenting vulnerabilities that should be overcome with the implementation of the new system. The blockchain-based system provides financial management for the collection of waste in the municipality aiming at better health and socio-environmental education and the financial and social inclusion of volunteer citizens, through the use of social currency. The proposed application uses social crypto-coins and security support through Ethereum's Blockchain, instead of the printed cards currently being used, including volunteer citizens, store owners and public agents. It should contribute in a relevant way to improving the quality of life in the municipality in relation to the typical aspects of sustainability: education, health, environment, social inclusion and local economy, contributing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed application may eventually expand in to other municipalities, including major urban centers and private condominiums.},

One key element in this action plan is the improvement of the economics and quality of recycled plastics. In addition, an important goal is that by 2030, all plastics packaging placed on the EU market must either be reusable or can be recycled in a cost-effective manner. This means that, at the end, a closed-loop recycling of food packaging materials should be established. However, the use of recyclates must not result in less severe preventive consumer protection of food packaging materials. This may lead to a conservative evaluation of authorities on post-consumer recyclates in food packaging applications. On the other hand, over-conservatism might over-protect the consumer and generate insurmountable barriers to the application of post-consumer recyclates for food packaging and, hence, counteract the targets of circular economy. The objective of this review is to provide an insight into the evaluation of post-consumer recyclates applied in direct contact to food. Safety assessment criteria as developed by the European Food Safety Authority EFSA will be presented, explained, and critically discussed.},

Design: Through an iterative process driven by PLHIV, the Stigma Index was revised, pretested, and formally evaluated in three cross-sectional studies. Methods: Between March and October 2017, 1153 surveys (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}377, Cameroon; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}390, Senegal; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}391, Uganda) were conducted with PLHIV at least 18 years old who had known their status for at least 1 year. PLHIV interviewers administered the survey on tablet computers or mobile phones to a diverse group of purposively sampled respondents recruited through PLHIV networks, community-based organizations, HIV clinics, and snowball sampling. Sixty respondents participated in cognitive interviews (20 per country) to assess if questions were understood as intended, and eight focus groups (Uganda only) assessed relevance of the survey, overall. Results: The Stigma Index 2.0 performed well and was relevant to PLHIV in all three countries. HIV-related stigma was experienced by more than one-third of respondents, including in HIV care settings. High rates of stigma experienced by key populations (such as MSM and sex workers) impeded access to HIV services. Many PLHIV also demonstrated resilience per the new PLHIV Resilience Scale. Conclusion: The Stigma Index 2.0 is now more relevant to the current context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and response. Results will be critical for addressing gaps in program design and policies that must be overcome to support PLHIV engaging in services, adhering to antiretroviral therapy, being virally suppressed, and leading healthy, stigma-free lives.},

The contamination even increases when covering areas of a high population density as is also evident from experience in Germany with a steadily increasing proportion of bio-waste. Only compost with high quality and minimum contamination is an acceptable fertilizer. A structured interview of experts investigated which measures or combinations of measures are best suitable to reduce the rate of misplaced materials in the organic waste. Only responsible persons were interviewed whose municipalities extensively collect separately bio-waste since years and have a low rate of unwanted materials. The questions focus on the identification of the misplacements according to their kind and quantity, the respective collection system, the regional statutes and their enforcement as well as the kind and extent of public awareness measures. The respective necessary measures are being discussed. This systemic approach can be transferred to other regions that intend to collect large quantities of bio-waste separately.},

However, there is substantial heterogeneity in progress between countries and inequality within countries. Methods We assessed countries' temporal patterns in access to drinking water and sanitation using publicly available data. We then classified countries using non-linear modeling techniques as having one of the following trajectories: 100\% coverage, linear growth, linear decline, no change, saturation, acceleration, deceleration, negative acceleration, or negative deceleration. We further assessed the degree to which temporal profiles follow a sigmoidal pattern and how these patterns might vary within a given country between rural and urban settings. Results Among countries with more than 10 data points, between 15\% and 38\% showed a non-linear trajectory, depending on the indicator. Overall, countries' progress followed a sigmoidal trend, but some countries are making better progress and some worse progress than would be expected. We highlight several countries that are not on track to meet the MDG for water or sanitation, but whose access is accelerating, suggesting better performance during the coming years. Conversely, we also highlight several countries that have made sufficient progress to meet the MDG target, but in which access is decelerating. Discussion Patterns were heterogeneous and non-linearity was common. Characterization of these heterogeneous patterns will help policy makers allocate resources more effectively. For example, policy makers can identify countries that could make use of additional resources or might be in need of additional institutional capacity development to properly manage resources; this will be essential to meet the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals.},

We then classified countries using non-linear modeling techniques as having one of the following trajectories: 100\% coverage, linear growth, linear decline, no change, saturation, acceleration, deceleration, negative acceleration, or negative deceleration. We further assessed the degree to which temporal profiles follow a sigmoidal pattern and how these patterns might vary within a given country between rural and urban settings. Results Among countries with more than 10 data points, between 15\% and 38\% showed a non-linear trajectory, depending on the indicator. Overall, countries' progress followed a sigmoidal trend, but some countries are making better progress and some worse progress than would be expected. We highlight several countries that are not on track to meet the MDG for water or sanitation, but whose access is accelerating, suggesting better performance during the coming years. Conversely, we also highlight several countries that have made sufficient progress to meet the MDG target, but in which access is decelerating. Discussion Patterns were heterogeneous and non-linearity was common. Characterization of these heterogeneous patterns will help policy makers allocate resources more effectively. For example, policy makers can identify countries that could make use of additional resources or might be in need of additional institutional capacity development to properly manage resources; this will be essential to meet the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals.},

This work investigates the structure-property relationship of blending virgin HDPE (vHDPE) with these different grades of repeatedly melt-extruded HDPE (rHDPE). HDPE was subjected to 10, 20 and 50 melt-extrusion cycles and blended with vHDPE. No significant difference in terms of melt rheology, tensile properties and overall migration in acidic and aqueous environments of the blends of the different rHDPEs with vHDPE was observed when compared to vHDPE. This study demonstrates the feasibility of blending up to 50~wt.-\% rHDPE of different grades with vHDPE as set out in the UK Dairy Roadmap.},

  abstract = {The circular economy rationale is increasingly promoted as a means to move from a global plastic waste dilemma to a plastics economy that is aligned with the principles of sustainable development. However, any such effort will have to account for the socio-economic settings in low-income and middle-income countries of the global south which are the main entry points of mismanaged plastic wastes into the environment. Since waste management and recycling in these economies are characterized by a great degree of informality, there is an urgent need to find models for partnering with the informal recycling sector in an effective, scalable, and sustainable manner. In this work, we present the case of a for-profit company located in Nairobi, Kenya, that operates on the interface between formal and informal by processing post-consumer plastics sourced from local waste pickers through a fair-trade-like business model. Economic incentives, trust building measures, and a general willingness to learn and adapt were identified as prerequisites for establishing accountable supplier-buyer relationships. The combination of informed material pre-sorting by the individual waste picker and subsequent industrial scale sorting and washing resulted in recyclates that were comparable to commercially available benchmark recyclates from the sophisticated formal recycling system of a high-income country in terms of both composition and selected engineering properties. High-quality mechanical recycling of plastic wastes under informal conditions seems feasible and may even come along with socio-economic benefits for marginalized waste pickers when suitable modes of cooperation are put in place.},

Improved cookstoves have been disseminated as an alternative to reduce these impacts. However, few detailed studies about the economic benefits of improved cookstoves (ICS) interventions, including environmental and health co-benefits, exist to date. In this paper we perform a comprehensive economic evaluation of a dissemination program of ICS in rural Mexico. The resulting cost\textendash benefit analysis (CBA) of the Patsari improved cookstove is presented, utilizing estimation of direct costs and benefits, including fuelwood savings, income generation, health impacts, environmental conservation, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis is based on comprehensive data obtained through monitoring studies carried out in the Study Area from 2003 to the present. Results show that Patsari cookstoves represent a viable economic option for improving living conditions of the poorest inhabitants of rural Mexico, with benefit/cost ratios estimated between 11.4:1 and 9:1. The largest contributors to economic benefits stemmed from fuelwood savings and reductions in health impacts, which constituted 53\% and 28\% of the overall benefit, respectively.},

  abstract = {Black carbon (BC) emissions from household cookstoves consuming solid fuel produce approximately 25 percent of total anthropogenic BC emissions. The short atmospheric lifetime of BC means that reducing BC emissions would result in a faster climate response than mitigating CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases. This study presents the results of optical BC measurements of two new cookstove emissions field assessments and 17 archived cookstove datasets. BC was determined from attenuation of 880~nm light, which is strongly absorbed by BC, and linearly related between 1 and 125 attenuation units. A relationship was experimentally determined correlating BC mass deposition on quartz filters determined via thermal optical analysis (TOA) and on PTFE and quartz filters using transmissometry, yielding an attenuation cross-section ({$\sigma$}ATN) for both filter media types. {$\sigma$}ATN relates TOA measurements to optical measurements on PTFE and quartz ({$\sigma$}ATN(PTFE)~=~13.7~cm-2~{$\mu$}g, R2~=~0.87, {$\sigma$}ATN(Quartz)~=~15.6~cm-2~{$\mu$}g, R2~=~0.87). These filter-specific {$\sigma$}ATN, optical measurements of archived filters were used to determine BC emission factors and the fraction of particulate matter (PM) in the form of black carbon (BC/PM). The 19 stoves measured fell into five stove classes; simple wood, rocket, advanced biomass, simple charcoal, and advanced charcoal. Advanced biomass stoves include forced- and natural-draft gasifiers which use wood or biomass pellets as fuel. Of these classes, the simple wood and rocket stoves demonstrated the highest median BC emission factors, ranging from 0.051 to 0.14~g~MJ-1. The lowest BC emission factors were seen in charcoal stoves, which corresponds to the generally low PM emission factors observed during charcoal combustion, ranging from 0.0084 to 0.014~g~MJ-1. The advanced biomass stoves generally showed an improvement in BC emissions factors compared to simple wood and rocket stoves, ranging from 0.0031 to 0.071~g~MJ-1. BC/PM ratios were highest for the advanced and rocket stoves. Potential relative climate impacts were estimated by converting aerosol emissions to CO2-equivalent, and suggest that some advanced stove/fuel combinations could provide substantial climate benefits.},

While the technologies have improved considerably, organizations still face challenges in making them financially sustainable. Financial sustainability questions the business models behind these water technologies. This article makes three contributions to business models in the context of fluoride and arsenic mitigation. Firstly, we describe four business models: A) low-value devices given away to people living in extreme poverty, B) high-value devices sold to low-income customers, C) communities as beneficiaries of micro-water treatment plants and D) entrepreneurs as franchisees for selling water services and highlight the emergence of hybrid business models. Secondly, we show current business model innovations such as cost transparency \& cost reductions, secured \& extended water payments, business diversification and distribution channels. Thirdly, we describe skills and competencies as part of capacity building for creating even more business model innovations. Together, these three contributions will create more awareness of the role of business models in scaling-up water treatment technologies.},

The very notion of the industrial ecosystem is motivated by the idea that we should learn from natural ecosystems how to ``close the loop.''

Unfortunately, how the IE community and the public at large think about recycling includes several misconceptions that have the potential to misguide environmental assessments, policies, and actions that deal with recycling and thus undermine its environmental potential. One misconception stems from na\"ive assumptions regarding recycled material displacing primary production. Two others assert the environmental advantages of recycling material multiple times, or at least in a closed loop. A final misconception is the assumption that the distinction between closed and open recycling loops is generally useful. This article explains why these misconceptions are flawed, discusses the implications, and presents an alternative set of principles to better harness the potential environmental benefits of closing material loops.},

However, robust global information, particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9\% of which had been recycled, 12\% was incinerated, and 79\% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

Quantification of the amount of non-renewable woody biomass through a robust and widely applicable method is urgently needed for a wide variety of applications including cookstove carbon-offset projects, national GHG inventories, and sustainable forest management strategies under REDD+. Within this context, we developed ``Mofuss'' (Modeling fuelwood savings scenarios), a dynamic model that simulates the spatiotemporal effect of fuelwood harvesting on the landscape vegetation and that accounts for savings in non-renewable woody biomass from reduced consumption. The model was tested in western Honduras where collected and marketed fuelwood is used by the residential sector in both urban and rural settlements. We argue that geospatial modeling, aimed at representing real situations more closely while integrating uncertainty, should be used in calculations of carbon savings from cookstove projects or fuel switching interventions.},

Spectral aerosol optical depth ({$\tau$}) and single scattering albedo ({$\omega$}o) from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements are used to form absorption (i.e., {$\omega$}o and absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent ({$\alpha$}abs)) and size (i.e., extinction \AA ngstr\"om exponent ({$\alpha$}ext) and fine mode fraction of {$\tau$}) relationships to infer dominant aerosol types. Using the long-term AERONET data set (1999\textendash 2010), 19 sites are grouped by aerosol type based on known source regions to (1) determine the average{$\omega$}o and {$\alpha$}abs at each site (expanding upon previous work), (2) perform a sensitivity study on {$\alpha$}abs by varying the spectral {$\omega$}o, and (3) test the ability of each absorption and size relationship to distinguish aerosol types. The spectral {$\omega$}o averages indicate slightly more aerosol absorption (i.e., a 0.0 {$<$} {$\delta\omega$}o {$\leq$} 0.02 decrease) than in previous work, and optical mixtures of pollution and smoke with dust show stronger absorption than dust alone. Frequency distributions of {$\alpha$}abs show significant overlap among aerosol type categories, and at least 10\% of the {$\alpha$}abs retrievals in each category are below 1.0. Perturbing the spectral {$\omega$}o by {$\pm$}0.03 induces significant {$\alpha$}abs changes from the unperturbed value by at least {$\sim\pm$}0.6 for Dust, {$\sim\pm$}0.2 for Mixed, and {$\sim\pm$}0.1 for Urban/Industrial and Biomass Burning. The {$\omega$}o440nm and {$\alpha$}ext440\textendash 870nmrelationship shows the best separation among aerosol type clusters, providing a simple technique for determining aerosol type from surface- and future space-based instrumentation.},

Limited attention has so far been paid to the influence of power relations over this gap. This article presents, therefore, an interpretive synthesis of qualitative health policy articles addressing the question: how do actors at the front line of health policy implementation exercise discretionary power, with what consequences and why? The article also demonstrates the particular approach of thematic synthesis and contributes to discussion of how such work can inform future health policy research. The synthesis drew from a broader review of published research on any aspect of policy implementation in LMICs for the period 1994\textendash 2009. From an initial set of 50 articles identified as relevant to the specific review question, a sample of 16 articles were included in this review. Nine report experience around decentralization, a system-level change, and seven present experience of implementing a range of reproductive health (RH) policies (new forms of service delivery). Three reviewers were involved in a systematic process of data extraction, coding, analysis, synthesis and article writing. The review findings identify: the practices of power exercised by front-line health workers and their managers; their consequences for policy implementation and health system performance; the sources of this power and health workers' reasons for exercising power. These findings also provide the basis for an overarching synthesis of experience, highlighting the importance of actors, power relations and multiple, embedded contextual elements as dimensions of health system complexity. The significance of this synthesis lies in its insights about: the micropractices of power exercised by front-line providers; how to manage this power through local level strategies both to influence and empower providers to act in support of policy goals; and the focus and nature of future research on these issues.}

If the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development is to be achieved, sustainable waste management approaches must be an environmental and public health imperative deserving political priority. Current reasons for the poor management of waste in Africa, include, amongst others, weak organizational structures; lack of appropriate skills; inadequate budgets; weak legislation; lack of enforcement; low public awareness; corruption, conflict; political instability; and lack of political will. At the heart of the problem, is a failure in governance. However, through these gaps, many social and technological innovations have emerged. Innovations that recognize the opportunity that waste provides as a secondary resource. Diverting waste away from dumpsites and landfills towards reuse, recycling and recovery can improve the livelihoods of thousands of informal waste reclaimers, while also creating new jobs and business opportunities for the continent. Reintroducing secondary resources such as polymer, fiber, metals and nutrients back into local value chains has the potential to strengthen manufacturing economies and reduce the economic burden on product imports. Bringing waste under control in Africa and unlocking the opportunities that ``waste'' provides as ``resource'' will require immediate intervention by government, business and civil society.},

Waste plastic is a particularly problematic one, with single-use plastic leaking into the environment, including the marine environment, at an unprecedented rate. Around the world, countries are taking action to minimise these impacts, including banning single-use plastics; changing petroleum-based plastics to alternative bio-benign products such as paper, glass or biodegradable plastics; and improving waste collection systems to ensure that all waste is appropriately collected and reprocessed or safely disposed. However, these ``solutions'' are often met with resistance, from business, government or civil society, due to the intended and unintended consequences, leaving many questioning the most appropriate solution to reducing the leakage. This paper argues that there is no one single solution to addressing the leakage of plastic into the environment, but that the solution is likely to be a combination of the three approaches, based on local considerations.},

  abstract = {The circular economy is not new to South Africa. As a country facing high levels of unemployment, poverty, and inequality, end-of-life products are often repaired and reused, driven largely by an active informal sector. As a water scarce country, grey water has been recycled and reused for decades, with returns making up 13\% of South Africa's available water. And facing an energy crisis since 2007, renewable energy has grown to 11\% of South Africa's energy supply. While there is certainly much progress still to be made in scaling-up activities in the waste, energy, and water sectors, this chapter provides insights into some of the initiatives already in place to catalyse South Africa's transition to a more circular economy. In addition to the sector opportunities, the chapter also explores the role of government, business, and science, technology, and innovation in unlocking a circular economy in South Africa. It is acknowledged that further circular economy opportunities in resource-intensive sectors such as agriculture, human settlements, transport, and manufacturing need to be identified, and that more needs to be done in addressing ``early stage'' product design and resource demand. However, based on a growing body of knowledge, it is clear that the circular economy provides opportunities to address issues of national resource scarcity and security through sustainable resource utilisation. It provides opportunities to move the country forward in its local and international environmental commitments and development objectives. And it provides very real opportunities to strengthen local manufacturing, reduce dependence on resource imports, unlock new economic opportunities, improve the sustainability of other investment areas, create jobs, and position South Africa in the short term for a post-COVID19 green economic recovery and in the long term for a post-mining economy.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Combustion of biomass, garbage, and fossil fuels in South Asia has led to poor air quality in the region and has uncertain climate forcing impacts. Online measurements of submicron aerosol (PM1) emissions were conducted as part of the Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source Testing Experiment (NAMaSTE) to investigate and report emission factors (EFs) and vacuum aerodynamic diameter (dva) size distributions from prevalent but poorly characterized combustion sources. The online aerosol instrumentation included a ``mini'' aerosol mass spectrometer (mAMS) and a dual-spot eight-channel aethalometer (AE33). The mAMS measured non-refractory PM1 mass, composition, and size. The AE33-measured black carbon (BC) mass and estimated light absorption at 370\,nm due to organic aerosol or brown carbon. Complementary gas-phase measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) were collected using a Picarro Inc. cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS) to calculate fuel-based EFs using the carbon mass balance approach. The investigated emission sources include open garbage burning, diesel-powered irrigation pumps, idling motorcycles, traditional cookstoves fueled with dung and wood, agricultural residue fires, and coal-fired brick-making kilns, all of which were tested in the field. Open-garbage-burning emissions, which included mixed refuse and segregated plastics, were found to have some of the largest PM1 EFs (3.77\textendash 19.8\,g\,kg-1) and the highest variability of the investigated emission sources. Non-refractory organic aerosol (OA) size distributions measured by the mAMS from garbage-burning emissions were observed to have lognormal mode dva values ranging from 145 to 380\,nm. Particle-phase hydrogen chloride (HCl) was observed from open garbage burning and was attributed to the burning of chlorinated plastics. Emissions from two diesel-powered irrigation pumps with different operational ages were tested during NAMaSTE. Organic aerosol and BC were the primary components of the emissions and the OA size distributions were centered at {$\sim$}80\,nm dva. The older pump was observed to have significantly larger EFOA than the newer pump (5.18\,g\,kg-1 compared to 0.45\,g\,kg-1) and similar EFBC. Emissions from two distinct types of coal-fired brick-making kilns were investigated. The less advanced, intermittently fired clamp kiln was observed to have relatively large EFs of inorganic aerosol, including sulfate (0.48\,g\,kg-1) and ammonium (0.17\,g\,kg-1), compared to the other investigated emission sources. The clamp kiln was also observed to have the largest absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent (AAE\,=\,4) and organic carbon (OC) to BC ratio (OC\,:\,BC\,=\,52). The continuously fired zigzag kiln was observed to have the largest fraction of sulfate emissions with an EFSO4 of 0.96\,g\,kg-1. Non-refractory aerosol size distributions for the brick kilns were centered at {$\sim$}400\,nm dva. The biomass burning samples were all observed to have significant fractions of OA and non-refractory chloride; based on the size distribution results, the chloride was mostly externally mixed from the OA. The dung-fueled traditional cookstoves were observed to emit ammonium, suggesting that the chloride emissions were partially neutralized. In addition to reporting EFs and size distributions, aerosol optical properties and mass ratios of OC to BC were investigated to make comparisons with other NAMaSTE results (i.e., online photoacoustic extinctiometer (PAX) and off-line filter based) and the existing literature. This work provides critical field measurements of aerosol emissions from important yet under-characterized combustion sources common to South Asia and the developing world.},

Based on fieldwork in North China?s informal recycling sector and data from gazetteers, government documents, news articles, and Chinese blogs, this article sketches how the informal waste sector developed in Wenan since the 1980s and analyzes how local government approaches to the sector changed as the devastating pollution and health effects of the industry became increasingly apparent. While the 2011 crackdown finally eliminated the sector from Wenan county, it predictably resulted in scattering these polluting enterprises throughout the region to work in more covert conditions, contributing to a ?race to the bottom? dynamic in the sector. The conclusion proposes an alternative policy approach to the problem and briefly evaluates a national-scale initiative against the sector being planned for 2016.},

  abstract = {In this thesis the feasibility of making social transfers conditional in South Africa is examined with specific focus on the Child Support Grant. Currently, there are more than 8.7 million children receiving Child Support Grants, which is impacting positively on poverty alleviation. Yet, social outcomes, especially in health and education are poor. The conditionality of transfers will compel the parents/guardians of these children to ensure that the children regularly attend school and also utilise the health services. Conditional cash transfers, by their nature, attempt to address the low demand for these services, which are available but are not being utilised.  The National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) is employed to test empirically whether it will be feasible to institute conditionality to the CSG. The methodology adopted is to determine if there is any statistically significant difference (education and health outcomes) between the recipients of the CSG with non-recipients of the CSG. Moreover, the population (as extrapolated from the sample) is separated into four groups, namely, children that qualify and receive the grant (QR), children that qualify and do not receive the grant (QNR), children that do not qualify and receive the grant (NQR) and children that do not qualify and do not receive the grant (NQNR). Subsequently, educational and health outcomes are compared between these groups to determine if there is any statistically significant difference between them.  The results demonstrate that school attendance is high among children, and there is no significant difference in school attendance between the recipients and non-recipients of the CSG; as well as between the QR, QNR, NQR and NQNR. Moreover, there is no substantial difference in education outcomes (grade repetition) between the recipients and non-recipients of the CSG; as well as between the four groups. Similar results are found for health where there is no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding utilisation of health services as well as health outcomes.  Therefore, conditionality of the CSG would not be feasible, as it does not address the causes of poor health and education outcomes, which are mainly due to supply-side deficiencies. Government should rather strengthen current poverty alleviation policies which seem to be impacting positively on poverty reduction.},

It investigates the extent to which intersectionality through structural, disciplinary, hegemonic and interpersonal power associated with poor, marginalised groups influence their entrepreneurial actions and rights collectively. Studies either view entrepreneurs through an informality lens, as marginalised populations engaged in low-quality activities, or through a formality lens, as engaged in relatively higher quality entrepreneurial activities more as a necessity choice. The aim of this paper is to evaluate critically these explanations through intersectionality power in relation to waste pickers entrepreneurs in the informal sector in Colombia.}

Using existing Joint Monitoring Programme facility classifications and secondary data on piped water access, a Service Typology was developed to classify and quantify the primary emptying service needs of household level onsite sanitation facilities. Facilities in six Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) regions were classified as Emptiable (faecal sludge can be removed either via Mechanized or Non-Mechanized means) or Unemptiable. Of the 722 million household level sanitation facilities assessed in these regions, 32\% were found to be emptiable via Mechanized means, 50\% via Non-Mechanized means and 18\% were found to be Unemptiable pits. The volume (by number of facilities) and density (as a proportion of the full population) of each service type were estimated by SDG region and by country. Results from this study provide background data on the role of emptying sanitation facilities in achieving SDG6, and can be incorporated into investment priorities, policy framing, technology development, infrastructure development, and targeted behaviour change strategies.},

For this purpose, a case study was carried out, considering as analysis unit the Brazilian sectoral agreement of reverse logistics of packaging. The data collection was conducted through documental analysis and interviews with waste pickers associations, managers in the business sector and government representatives, who are the key signatories of the agreement in focus. The results were triangulated in order to show different perspectives unveiled by the research sources and methods. The analysis of results was carried out based on content analysis proposed by Bardin (1977), in which categories were defined a priori and adjusted a posteriori. The main results show that the concept of circular economy, although not formally expressed in the Brazilian law and sectoral agreement, guides the actions developed by the signatories of the agreement. This article can serve as an input for researchers and practitioners interested in sectoral agreements in Brazil and in developing countries, as well as input for managers in the public and private sectors and other key stakeholders concerned with the implementation of reverse logistics under relevant legislations on solid waste management that reinforce transitions to the circular economy.},

Data were collected from interviews, document analysis and site visits. The challenges for the recycling industry stem from various upstream and downstream actors in the recycling value chain (broadly stakeholders), waste system stages and enabling environment. Sri Lanka, far from being a circular economy, faces many social, environmental, and economic problems. They need remedial action based on these challenges through awareness creation, capacity building, investment in infrastructure and technology, law enforcement and policy implementation, international collaboration, private\textendash public partnership, fiscal policy support, and industry formalization. Thus, the solutions call for a multi-faceted and all stakeholder-inclusive approach.},

  abstract = {Urban India generates about 42 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per annum. By 2050, 50 per cent of the country?s population is projected to be urban, and the amount of waste will increase substantially. The 12th Schedule of the Constitution of India makes it obligatory for municipal authorities to keep cities and towns clean. Given their wide range of responsibilities, however, dealing with waste in both practical and environmentally sound ways is one of their most significant challenges, and innovative solutions are called for. This paper presents research on solid waste management in the city of Chandigarh, well known in India for its achievements in this regard. It provides an overview of the situation, discussing the strategies adopted and the continued and emerging challenges in waste management, as well as suggesting measures for possible solutions.},

The affects of pollution are more apparent in developing countries such as China and India, because of various economic and demographic factors. In major cities, such as New Delhi, Beijing, the air pollution reaches hazardous levels, especially during winters. Air quality measurement is the first step toward mitigating the effects of air pollution; hence, there has been an effort to set up air quality measurement stations all over the world. However, the availability of these measurement stations is sparser in developing countries, where the air quality is lower. Hence, there is a need for low-cost air quality measurement devices. The following work presents a brief overview of various low-cost approaches to measuring air quality.},

In the city of Kisumu in Kenya, waste management is fragmented and insufficient with most household waste remaining uncollected. Solid waste enters and leaves public space through an intricate web of connected, mostly informal, actions. This article scrutinizes waste management of informal settlements, based on the case of Kisumu, to identify weak links in waste management chains and find neighborhood responses to bridge these gaps. Systems theory and action net theory support our analysis to understand the actions, actors, and processes associated with waste and its management. We use qualitative data from fieldwork and hands on engagement in waste management in Kisumu. Our main conclusion is that new waste initiatives should build on existing waste management practices already being performed within informal settlements by waste scavengers, waste pickers, waste entrepreneurs, and community-based organizations.},

Critical systems theory understands cities as urban metabolisms, with different material and energy flows, highlighting the circularity in production, consumption, and discard. Waste pickers in low- and medium-income countries work on dumps and landfills, sifting through highly contaminated household waste and are exposed to health hazards. This paper discusses the risk factors, hazards, and vulnerabilities waste pickers are exposed to during collection and separation of recyclables, based on the review of literature on waste and environmental health and on findings from participatory research with waste pickers conducted in Brazil. We take a social and environmental justice perspective and identify the vulnerabilities and waste-borne hazards of household waste, associated with these workers, their communities, watersheds, and the environment. Household waste, although not always per se toxic or hazardous, can become a hazard if not collected or inadequately managed. Those communities where household waste is not collected or waste collection is insufficient are the most critical places. Informal and organized waste pickers, municipal or private waste collectors/workers, small waste traders and sometimes residents, particularly small children, may be considered vulnerable if exposed to waste-borne hazards. The results include recommendations to address household waste-borne hazards and vulnerabilities, according to waste workers involved in this research.},

This article proposes to add a Southern lens, situated in the context of waste picker organizations, to the concept of CE. The discursive framework in this article couples ecological economy (EE) with social/solidarity economy (SSE), focusing not only on environmental sustainability but also on social, economic, political and cultural dimensions involved in production, consumption and discard. We acknowledge that grassroots movements contribute to policy making and improve urban waste management systems. The paper outlines two empirical studies (Argentina, Brazil) that illustrate how waste picker organizations perform selective waste collection services, engage with municipalities and industries, and practice the CE. The research reveals that social and political facets need to be added to the debate about the CE, linking environmental management and policy with community development and recognizing waste pickers as protagonists in the CE. Our findings emphasize a need for a change of persisting inequalities in public policy by recognizing the importance of popular waste management praxis and knowledge, ultimately redefining the CE.},

  abstract = {Worldwide waste pickers work under deplorable conditions and are not recognized for their environmental and community services, by recovering and diverting recyclable materials from waste. Brazil has accumulated experiences of international relevance, particularly between 2004 and 2015, due to institutional and policy support for the Social and Solidarity Economy and the creation of a National Waste Pickers' movement. These conditions have favored the formation of new recycling cooperatives throughout the country. While there is still a wide spectrum of differences among these membership-based organizations, they also have many characteristics in common and share similar values and objectives. This research aims to demonstrate that when organized and supported by public policies and inclusive governance these groups are able to tackle several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article presents results of a case study, conducted over the period of 5~months in 2018, involving 21 waste picker cooperatives in the metropolitan region of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil. Data collection included the application of a questionnaire to the leaders of the 21 cooperatives and site visits to their facilities, including informal conversations with members. Data was collected at the cooperatives and involved note taking and voice recording. The data was transcribed and tabled for the subsequent content analysis. The results demonstrate the impacts of the work of organized waste pickers on SDGs (goals \# 1, 5, 8, 11 and 12). The study shows how these groups address social, economic and environmental targets, how they build resilience and reduce vulnerabilities. Many cooperatives still operate under precarious conditions, suffering from weak government commitments and neglect or from the volatility of the economy. Public policies and participation in governance are instrumental in acknowledging waste picker organizations and remunerating their services to thus unlock their full potential to further the progress on the implementation of SDGs. Political will is paramount for waste pickers to become the champions in the transition to more sustainable development.},

Two case studies (Argentina and Brazil) demonstrate how waste pickers inform and educate the general public and raise the awareness of socio-environmental questions related to waste management. Different educational practices are used as strategies to confront citizens with their waste: to see waste as a consumption problem, resource, and income source. Our paper draws on grassroots learning (social movement learning and insurgent learning) and education (stewardship) aimed at the transformation of waste practices. We argue that waste pickers play an important role in knowledge production promoting recycling, in landfilling less and recovering more resources. We conclude that waste pickers act as insurgent citizens and also are environmental stewards.},

Recently, the LCS research community has focused largely on sensor calibration, pollution monitoring, and exposure assessment; here, we investigate the applicability of LCS for characterizing particulate pollution sources in an urban environment. Using an integrated multipollutant LCS system (which measures both gases and particles), we collected air quality data for 6 weeks during the winter at a site in Delhi, India. The results were compared to measurements taken by colocated research-grade particle instruments. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to deconvolve LCS data into unique factors that were then identified by examining the factor composition and comparing them to the research-grade measurements. The data were described well by three factors: a combustion factor characterized by high CO levels and two factors characterized by measured particles. These factors align well with measurements by research-grade instruments, including particle types determined from factor analysis of online particle composition measurements. This work demonstrates that multipollutant LCS measurements, despite their inherent limitations (e.g., calibration challenges and inability to measure smallest particles), can provide insight into sources of fine particulate matter in a complex urban environment.},

It converts plastic waste into a secondary material that can be fed back into the system, for use in the same or new components and products, with similar or lower functionality; hence ``closing the loop''. Up until today, research on examining the environmental impacts, economic implications and technicalities of plastic waste recycling deals with one particular aspect, or stage on the plastic value chain, lacking coherence and structure. To move this research forward, understanding the challenges and trade-offs in scaling up plastic waste recycling is necessary. Here, we bring together existing literature on the multi-faceted aspects of closing the plastic loop, critically debating on the multi-stakeholder endeavours of promoting circularity in the plastics value chain. We present an overview of how the design, production, collection and sorting of PCPW present challenges for plastic waste recycling, which in turn result to a number of trade-offs. We explain that the evaluation of the multi-dimensional implications of trade-offs arising from the PCPW recycling, is essential in measuring the long-term sustainability of resource recovery from waste systems. This work scrutinises the sustainability of closing the plastic waste loops and sets a future research agenda.},

  abstract = {Plastic is a commodity that supports our modern lifestyles. Its remarkable range of properties (e.g., durability, lightweight, good barrier properties) combined with the ease of processing make plastic a sustainable alternative over other materials (e.g., glass, metals, and paper), of which production, use, and management can be more resource intensive. Owing to these attributes, plastics are considered to have an important role to play in promoting sustainability as part of a circular economy (CE). CE is a concept that seeks to promote a sustainable way of living, where resources are used more efficiently and are retained in the economy for as long as possible. The latter can be achieved by creating loops that feed resources back into the system for use in same or new components and products with the same or lower functionality. Paradoxically, plastics present also one of the biggest challenges to achieving a CE. This is because, in spite of their great potential to promote resource efficiency upstream, i.e., at the production stage, a vast amount of the plastic that becomes waste escapes into the environment and/or is largely mismanaged at the consumption and management stage. This highlights the urgent need for scrutiny in the way plastics are designed, produced, used, and managed, to better understand how to improve their ability to circulate back into the system, recovering maximum value from them. In this chapter, we present a framework for plastic waste management placing emphasis on their circularity potential via existing processes. Given the rapid emergence of bioplastics in the plastic industry, it would be an omission not to discuss their opportunities and implications in promoting circularity. Consideration of all aspects in the plastic and plastic waste system and of the processes that go beyond end-of-pipe solutions highlights that sustainable management necessitates a combination of an integrated solid waste management strategy with a renewed focus on designing out plastic waste.},

  note = {Therefore, greater focus is needed not only on reducing overreliance on plastics but also in finding ways to promote their circularity potential in the system, given that this is the best way of minimizing the environmental, economic, technical, and social impacts associated with plastic waste. This is because circularity is strongly dependent on the material from which plastics are made of, type of plastics, sociopolitical context, and local specificities where plastic waste is generated, used, and managed. Therefore, for assessing plastics' circularity potential, one must understand the types of material from which plastics are made of, and their respective attributes as these will determine their use, collection, and management (Section 22.2).},

The act began a series of legislative measures extending through the Victorian era and into this century in which the state became guarantor of standards of health and environmental quality and provided means for local units of government to make the structural changes to meet those standards. That public action can substantially improve the health of the general population now seems obvious, and it also seems obvious that public authorities owe their citizens that improvement. Both were controversial in the 1830s and 1840s. For centuries European governments had reacted to epidemics with decrees. With medical boards to advise them, they set their military forces to protecting borders and ports, whitewashed towns, fumigated dwellings, and burnt bedding. The threat of unusual disease prompted these reactions, and they were relaxed when the epidemics passed.1 Normal disease\textemdash infant mortality of more than 50\% in inner city wards, annual mortality of over 30/1000 in some towns\textemdash prompted no such reactions. Unless we are familiar with some of the cities of the developing world, most of us are probably unable to fathom the enormity of the unplanned urbanisation of the 19th century: roughly 3~million people(slightly over 30\%) were urban in 1801~in England and Wales, compared with 28.5~million (almost 80\%) in 1901.~Growth rates in some textile boom towns, like Bradford from 1811~to 1831,~exceeded 60\% per decade; this despite the fact that towns were acting as a sink for human life.

  abstract = {Waste management in rural areas has become a major challenge for governments of developing countries. The success of waste management decisions directly lies in the accuracy and reliability of the data on which choices are based; many factors influence these data. Here, we examined the factors influencing domestic waste in rural areas of developing countries (RADIC), using both field surveys and by reviewing previous literature. The social factors included population, education and culture. There was a positive linear relationship between waste generation amount and population size (R2\,=\,0.9405). Environmental education, training and demonstration projects played a positive role in improving people's awareness of the benefits of recycling and reducing waste. Traditional and national cultures, consumption and living habits contributed to variations in the generation and composition of domestic waste. Generally, practices related to conservation of and reverence for nature and green consumption encourage people to reduce, reuse and recycle waste in their daily life. Economic factors included household income and expenditure, energy and fuel structure, and types of industry that occurred in villages. A Kuznets inverted ``U'' curve relationship existed between domestic waste generation and people's income in rural areas of China. However, the waste generation rate had a linear relationship with the gross national income per capita in RADIC. The composition, bulk density and calorific value of domestic waste were variously affected by the energy and fuel structure and the types of industry that occurred. The natural factors included geography and climate (including rainfall, humidity, temperature and harvest seasons). The moisture content of waste was directly influenced by rainfall and humidity. Temperature affected waste characteristics by influencing residential heating modes. The waste characteristics were also influenced by the mixing of agricultural and aquacultural waste into domestic waste in the harvesting season. In different geographies, significant differences of domestic waste characteristics were observed as a result of comprehensive effects caused by multiple factors. Other factors included the administrative levels of communities and survey methods. The characteristics of domestic waste in towns or central villages were similar with those in cities, but were different from those in common villages (the smallest type of community). The domestic waste sampled in households indicated a lower rate of generation and lower ash content than when the waste was sampled at transfer stations or dumping sites.

  abstract = {Accumulated evidence from dozens of cash transfer programmes across the world suggest that there are few interventions that can match the range of impacts and cost-effectiveness of a small, predictable monetary transfer to poor families in developing countries. These results lead many policymakers to consider cash transfer programmes the `gold-standard' in anti-poverty policy with some even advocating for benchmarking all development interventions against what would have been accomplished with a direct cash transfer. However, the benchmarking argument rests on the accumulated evidence from many programmes that highlights the range of potential benefits of cash transfers, while each individual study typically focused on only one programme and one outcome. This article is the first to provide comprehensive impact results of an unconditional cash transfer from one programme, covering many outcomes in poverty, social and economic domains. We implement an experimental design to evaluate the Zambian Government's Child Grant, an unconditional cash transfer to families with small children in three of the poorest districts of Zambia. We document the broad impacts of the programme, including on consumption, livelihood strengthening, material welfare of children, young child feeding, investment in assets, productive activities and housing after two years, making this one of the first studies to demonstrate both protective and productive impacts of a national unconditional cash transfer programme. However impacts in areas such as child nutritional status and schooling depend on initial conditions of the household, suggesting that cash alone is not enough to solve all constraints faced by these poor, rural households. Even an unconditional cash transfer programme with a wide range of impacts does not produce effects for all outcomes, suggesting that complementary programmes to achieve specific outcomes will still be necessary even in the most successful cases.},

A number of choice modelling methods are consistent with consumer theory, their focus on an attribute-based theory of value permits a superior representation of many environmental management contexts. However, choice modelling surveys can place a severe cognitive burden upon respondents and induce satisficing rather than maximising behavioural patterns. In this framework, we seek to identify the best available choice modelling alternative and investigate its potential to `solve' some of the major biases associated with standard contingent valuation. We then discuss its use in the light of policy appraisal needs within the EU. An application to the demand for rock climbing in Scotland is provided as an illustration.},

This paper explores the everyday ways in which citizens negotiate public infrastructure delivery and access, situated in a global South context of extreme inequality and limited state capacity. Using a case study of two low-income settlements in Cape Town with differing infrastructure provision, we demonstrate how governance processes can undermine the physical delivery of infrastructure. While participatory governance remains a core policy mechanism to democratise service delivery, in practice the capacity of citizens to participate is affected by power and knowledge asymmetries that function both within and between communities and the state. These asymmetric power relations and knowledge flows contribute to clientelistic politics that not only limit citizen engagement in participatory governance, but actively undermine low-income urban dwellers' access to services that have been physically delivered and targeted to meet their needs. Framed by a case study of energy interventions, we conclude that widening access to public infrastructure requires significant investment in effective governance processes for low-income urban dwellers.},

To examine these questions, we use large-scale, panel experimental data from maize field trials throughout Malawi to estimate the expected physical returns to fertilizer use conditional on a range of agronomic factors and weather conditions. Using these estimated returns and historical price and weather data, we simulate the expected profitability of fertilizer application over space and time. We find that the fertilizer bundles distributed under Malawi's subsidy program are almost always profitable in expectation, although our results may be reasonably interpreted as upper-bound estimates among more skilled farmers given that the experimental subjects were not randomly selected. These results are robust to a tripling of fertilizer prices, to a 50 percent decrease in the maize price, and to drought conditions. We then correlate estimated expected returns to fertilizer use with geographically disaggregated estimates of headcount poverty rates. We find a very weak positive correlation between poverty and the expected returns to fertilizer, which calls into question how spatially distributionally progressive fertilizer subsidies are in helping to reduce poverty among Malawian farmers.},

Design/methodology/approach Field research was exploratory, based on snowball sampling and urban traversing. The analysis follows capital and labour in the sub-circuits of capital generating waste in production, distribution, consumption, the production of labour and the reproduction of society. Findings Regardless of legal regulation, which is selectively enforced, formal contracts are limited to active inspection regimes; direct transactions with or within the state; and long-distance transactions. Formal labour contracts are least incomplete for state employment, and for relatively scarce skilled labour in the private sector. Research limitations/implications The research design does not permit quantified generalisations. Practical implications Waste management technology evaluations neglect the social costs of displacing a large informal labour force. Social implications While slowly dissolving occupational barriers of untouchability, the waste economy is a low-status labour absorber of last resort, exit from which is extremely difficult. Originality/value The first systematic exploration of formal and informal contracts in an Indian small-town waste economy.}

To investigate waste pickers' social and economic condition, including labor characteristics, household income, and poverty incidence, after the project's completion, 146 semi-structured survey questionnaires were administered to four communities adjacent to the landfill and 45 semi-structured interviews were completed with key stakeholders. Findings indicate that hundreds of waste pickers were displaced by the project, employment benefits from the project were unevenly distributed by neighborhood, and informal waste picking endures due to persistent impoverishment, thereby contributing to continued social and economic marginalization and environmental degradation. The findings highlight the limitations of inclusive neoliberal development efforts to transform MSWM in a low-income country.},

  abstract = {This report is the result of the SWITCH Innovation Lab ``Repositories \& Data Quality'', a project that ran from October 2020 until February 2021 as a collaboration between SWITCH and ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences. Its aim was to complement previous studies on research data management issues (conducted in part as earlier SWITCH Innovation Labs) and to identify relevant data sources for researchers in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in Switzerland. More particularly, the project focused on the reuse of existing data sets by SSH researchers and the criteria they applied when choosing a suitable data source for their work and research. Some of the steps in this task consisted of finding the locations where valuable data is shared, published and accessed as well as conducting a more specific investigation into data availability, modes of accessibility and aspects related to assessing data quality.  For this purpose, the project team designed and carried out an online survey targeted specifically at active SSH researchers in Switzerland. To disseminate the survey questionnaire towards this target audience, mailing lists of several research organizations in these fields were utilized. The survey ran for about 8 weeks until early February 2021 and received responses from 260 participants. Some of the main findings include a generally high number of researchers making use of existing data for their own work. Central data providers such as FORSbase, FSO and the GESIS data archive are the most frequently named sources. Trust in these data sources and sufficient additional materials like documentation and methodologies are key criteria for selecting data for reuse.  Some data sources could provide desired data sets but are hardly accessible and reusable for researchers (if at all). This mainly includes administrative data and records of (Swiss) public authorities and offices, as well as historic assets from archives, libraries and museums. Furthermore, qualitative research data like interviews, surveys, questionnaires and observations were often highlighted among valuable yet usually inaccessible data sources. At the same time, the case of qualitative data such as interview recordings and ethnographic fieldnotes illustrate well a certain reusability dilemma. To enable ``reusability'' of such materials from a legal perspective (i.e. to protect personal identities of research participants), much of sensitive context-related details need to be removed. Yet, it is exactly those details that are necessary to contextualize and reuse these data in a proper way from a qualitative researcher's point of view.  Finally, the list of relevant data sources in the SSH contains a large number of individual studies, data sets and resources. This fact supports the idea to connect and link this data, as repeatedly voiced by survey respondents. This demand presents a particular opportunity for future efforts in this area that directly align with the broad objectives at SWITCH. More specifically, the vision of the SWITCH Research Data Connectome is to interconnect research data from different sources, which contributes to the current development of a knowledge graph. Building on this knowledge base that documents and links metadata to enable a more effective search for and reuse of data, new specialized services could be employed in the future. The results of the SWITCH Innovation Lab ``Repositories \& Data Quality'' project shall help lay the groundwork for such future client-oriented services, by providing more detailed information about the handling and reuse of data in Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The problem of agricultural waste pollution has aroused wide concern around the world. An effective measure to solve this problem is to implement the compensation policy so as to encourage people to participate in agricultural waste recycling. This paper seeks to estimate households' willingness to accept compensation in terms of agricultural waste recycling adopting the contingent valuation method, and to calculate the compensation standard for households' participation in agricultural waste recycling by methods of non-parametric and parametric estimate. It aims to answer two questions: how much the compensation should be given for encouraging households to participate in agricultural waste recycling? Which factors would affect willingness to accept compensation value of households for participating in agricultural waste recycling? The results show that most households recognize the value of agricultural waste recycling and a certain amount of compensation which is about 1.08\%\textendash 1.31\% of average family annual income does encourage households to participate in agricultural waste recycling. Household's willingness to accept compensation and household's expected value of compensation are affected by personal or family characteristics (such as gender, household income) as well as the non-economic variables (such as environmental knowledge and environmental attitude). According to this research, reasonable compensation standard is the cornerstone of the effectiveness and efficiency of compensation policies. Household income inequality and capital allocation in terms of households' willingness to accept compensation should be taken into consideration when compensation policies about agricultural waste recycling are formulated. Environmental education for households is an effective measure to enhance their environmental consciousness, while raising the strength of government's waste management is turned out to be effective for improving the rural ecological environment. Conclusions of this study provide an important scientific basis for developing countries and regions to formulate compensation policies in terms of inspiring their agricultural waste recycling.},

Cohort studies provide sufficient evidence of associations of allcause and cardiopulmonary mortality with long-term average BC exposure. Studies of short-term health effects suggest that BC is a better indicator of harmful particulate substances from combustion sources (especially traffic) than undifferentiated particulate matter (PM) mass, but the evidence for the relative strength of association from long-term studies is inconclusive. The review of the results of all available toxicological studies suggested that BC may not be a major directly toxic component of fine PM, but it may operate as a universal carrier of a wide variety of chemicals of varying toxicity to the lungs, the body's major defence cells and possibly the systemic blood circulation. A reduction in exposure to PM2.5 containing BC and other combustion-related PM material for which BC is an indirect indicator should lead to a reduction in the health effects associated with PM.},

In this study, equivalent black carbon (eBC) concentrations were measured by using an aethalometer (AE33) at three different locations in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland from October 2015 to May 2017. One sampling site was located in an urban street canyon (SC, sampling period 18 months) and two of the sampling sites were located in suburban detached house (DH) areas (DH1, 13 months and DH2, 5 months). Based on the campaign averages, the eBC concentration levels were higher at the street canyon site (1690\,{$\pm$}\,1520\,ng/m3) than at the residential detached house areas (DH1\,=\,880\,{$\pm$}\,1500\,ng/m3 and DH2\,=\,1040\,{$\pm$}\,2130\,ng/m3). The contribution of eBC from fossil fuel (BCFF) and wood burning (BCWB) were estimated based on the spectral dependence of light absorption of different sources. The spectral behavior is described using absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent ({$\alpha$}) values for both fossil fuel ({$\alpha$}FF) and wood burning ({$\alpha$}WB) that were determined using concurrent wood burning tracer (levoglucosan) measurements. Based on the source apportionment, the contribution of BCWB to eBC was clearly higher at the detached house area sites DH1 (41\,{$\pm$}\,14\%) and DH2 (46\,{$\pm$}\,15\%) than at the urban street canyon site (15\,{$\pm$}\,14\%). A distinct seasonal dependency was observed in the eBC concentration levels at the detached house areas. The highest concentrations were detected during the cold seasons due to residential wood combustion. On the opposite, at the SC site, the concentration levels of eBC were rather constant throughout the campaign, being dominated by the BCFF emissions from close-by vehicular traffic. Substantial temporal and spatial variability in eBC concentrations and sources were observed within the Helsinki metropolitan area. eBC is shown to be closely tied to the characteristics of the measurement site, season, meteorological conditions and the time of the day.},

  abstract = {The absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent (AAE) describes the spectral dependence of light absorption by aerosols. AAE is typically used to differentiate between different aerosol types for example., black carbon, brown carbon, and dust particles. In this study, the variation of AAE was investigated mainly in fresh aerosol emissions from different fuel and combustion types, including emissions from ships, buses, coal-fired power plants, and residential wood burning. The results were assembled to provide a compendium of AAE values from different emission sources. A dual-spot aethalometer (AE33) was used in all measurements to obtain the light absorption coefficients at seven wavelengths (370\textendash 950 nm). AAE470/950 varied greatly between the different emission sources, ranging from -0.2 {$\pm$} 0.7 to 3.0 {$\pm$} 0.8. The correlation between the AAE470/950 and AAE370-950 results was good (R2 = 0.95) and the mean bias error between these was 0.02. In the ship engine exhaust emissions, the highest AAE470/950 values (up to 2.0 {$\pm$} 0.1) were observed when high sulfur content heavy fuel oil was used, whereas low sulfur content fuels had the lowest AAE470/950 (0.9\textendash 1.1). In the diesel bus exhaust emissions, AAE470/950 increased in the order of acceleration (0.8 {$\pm$} 0.1), deceleration (1.1 {$\pm$} 0.1), and steady driving (1.2 {$\pm$} 0.1). In the coal-fired power plant emissions, the variation of AAE470/950 was substantial (from -0.1 {$\pm$} 2.1 to 0.9 {$\pm$} 1.6) due to the differences in the fuels and flue gas cleaning conditions. Fresh wood-burning derived aerosols had AAE470/950 from 1.1 {$\pm$} 0.1 (modern masonry heater) to 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.1 (pellet boiler), lower than typically associated with wood burning, while the burn cycle phase affected AAE variation.},

Local management institutions are described, factors affecting inter-village differences in management institutions and collective action are analysed in a logit model, and the impact of institutions and other variables on common resource dependency and forest outcomes is tested using instrumental variable regression. Village population size has a positive effect and prior institutional experience a negative effect on the probability of collective action. It is concluded that efforts at improving forest management should not be confined to the poorest farmers. Large landowners are heavily involved in degrading use practises, especially when resources have good market potential. Local management institutions play a positive role in the area, but their impact appears insufficient to safeguard forests and commons from continued degradation. Conservation policies should target win\textendash win options through interventions aimed at improving technologies for private and common lands as well as institutional changes.},

Using a normative simulation model, we assess the extent of microplastic pollution in German agricultural soils originating from the land application of sewage sludge and compost. We estimate the microplastic concentration in German agricultural soils, the area of polluted land, and we compare the efficiency and effectiveness of some selected abatement measures. For 2020, we estimate that microplastic concentration in agricultural soil reaches a maximum concentration of between 30 and 50 mg/kg dry weight on 2\% of utilised agricultural area and a marginal concentration on 22\% of utilised agricultural area. Without the implementation of abatement measures, we expect the microplastic concentration to increase two to three times by 2060. Assessing the abatement measures, we find that for sewage sludge, thermal recycling is a more efficient and effective than equipping washing machines with microplastic-filters in private households. The use of plastic detection systems in the biowaste collection process reduces the plastic content of the compost and thus the release of microplastic into the soil. Detection systems are a more efficient measure for compost than thermal recycling. Concerning sludge, the findings indicate that the German strategy of thermally recycling sewage sludge is an efficient and effective measure to reduce microplastic pollution in soils. Reducing the plastic content of collected biowaste complies with the principles of a circular economy.},

Increasingly researchers and practitioners are estimating mixed logit models of various degrees of sophistication with mixtures of revealed preference and stated choice data. It is timely to review progress in model estimation since the learning curve is steep and the unwary are likely to fall into a chasm if not careful. These chasms are very deep indeed given the complexity of the mixed logit model. Although the theory is relatively clear, estimation and data issues are far from clear. Indeed there is a great deal of potential mis-inference consequent on trying to extract increased behavioural realism from data that are often not able to comply with the demands of mixed logit models. Possibly for the first time we now have an estimation method that requires extremely high quality data if the analyst wishes to take advantage of the extended behavioural capabilities of such models. This paper focuses on the new opportunities offered by mixed logit models and some issues to be aware of to avoid misuse of such advanced discrete choice methods by the practitioner.},

As customers in many countries face changing levels of water availability (especially shortages linked possibly to climate change and limited catchment capacity), the need to assess the value (and hence benefit) to society of varying service levels and prices in an effort to secure the provision of and disposal of water has risen on public agendas. In an attempt to establish how much customers are willing to pay for specific levels of service, we use a series of stated choice experiments and mixed logit models to establish the willingness to pay to avoid interruptions in water service and overflows of wastewater, differentiated by the frequency, timing and duration of these events. The empirical evidence is an important input into the regulatory process for establishing service levels and tariffs, as well as useful planning information for agencies charged with finding cost effective ways of delivering services at prices that customers deem to be value for money.},

Despite the limitations of sensors in terms of sensitivity and selectivity, it has been possible to use portable air monitors to determine pollution hotspots around the world.

Second, recovering project costs through the fixed tariff charged for water and wastewater services in Egypt may charge a substantial portion of a household more than they are willing to pay for the services.

  abstract = {In an earlier study in Karachi, Pakistan, households that received free soap and handwashing promotion for 9 months reported 53\% less diarrhea than controls. Eighteen months after the intervention ended, these households were enrolled in a follow-up study to assess sustainability of handwashing behavior. Upon re-enrollment, mothers in households originally assigned to the intervention were 1.5 times more likely to have a place with soap and water to wash hands (79\% versus 53\%, P = 0.001) and when asked to wash hands were 2.2 times more likely to rub their hands together at least three times (50\% versus 23\%, P = 0.002) compared with controls. In the ensuing 14 months, former intervention households reported a similar proportion of person-days with diarrhea (1.59\% versus 1.88\%, P = 0.66) as controls. Although intervention households showed better handwashing technique after 2 years without intervention, their soap purchases and diarrhea experience was not significantly different from controls.},

In this paper, various types of commonly used plastics (PE, PET, PP, PU, PVC, PS, ABS) as well as treated wood samples (LDF, low-density fibreboard) and firewood were combusted separately in a test stove under controlled conditions. The particulates emitted during the combustion test were collected on filters, potential tracers for each waste type were identified by GC-MS, and their relative abundances were determined. The emission factor of 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene was found to be higher for polymers containing aromatic rings in their structure. The application of terphenyls and quaterphenyls as tracer compounds has also been investigated. The trimer of styrene was found to be a potential tracer for the combustion of polystyrene and/or styrene-containing copolymers. Novel tracers were proposed for the burning of PET and furniture plates (LDF), which are among the most widely used waste types burned in households.},

The standard approach of specifying the distributions of the coefficients and deriving WTP as the ratio of two coefficients (estimation in preference space) is compared to specifying the distributions for WTP directly at the estimation stage (estimation in WTP space). The models in preference space fit the data better than the corresponding models in WTP space although the difference between the best fitting models in the two estimation regimes is minimal. Moreover, the willingness to pay estimates derived from the preference space models turn out to be very high for many of the job attributes. The results suggest that sensitivity testing using a variety of model specifications, including estimation in WTP space, is recommended when using mixed logit models to estimate willingness to pay distributions.},

  abstract = {Plastics are inexpensive, lightweight and durable materials, which can readily be moulded into a variety of products that find use in a wide range of applications. As a consequence, the production of plastics has increased markedly over the last 60 years. However, current levels of their usage and disposal generate several environmental problems. Around 4 per cent of world oil and gas production, a non-renewable resource, is used as feedstock for plastics and a further 3\textendash 4\% is expended to provide energy for their manufacture. A major portion of plastic produced each year is used to make disposable items of packaging or other short-lived products that are discarded within a year of manufacture. These two observations alone indicate that our current use of plastics is not sustainable. In addition, because of the durability of the polymers involved, substantial quantities of discarded end-of-life plastics are accumulating as debris in landfills and in natural habitats worldwide. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce these impacts and represents one of the most dynamic areas in the plastics industry today. Recycling provides opportunities to reduce oil usage, carbon dioxide emissions and the quantities of waste requiring disposal. Here, we briefly set recycling into context against other waste-reduction strategies, namely reduction in material use through downgauging or product reuse, the use of alternative biodegradable materials and energy recovery as fuel. While plastics have been recycled since the 1970s, the quantities that are recycled vary geographically, according to plastic type and application. Recycling of packaging materials has seen rapid expansion over the last decades in a number of countries. Advances in technologies and systems for the collection, sorting and reprocessing of recyclable plastics are creating new opportunities for recycling, and with the combined actions of the public, industry and governments it may be possible to divert the majority of plastic waste from landfills to recycling over the next decades.},

  abstract = {Background: By 2050, sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) urban population is expected to grow from 414 million to over 1.2 billion. This growth will likely increase challenges to municipalities attempting to provide access to water supply and sanitation (WS\&S). This study aims to characterize trends in access to WS\&S in SSA cities and identify factors affecting those trends. Methods: DHS data collected between 2000 and 2012 were used for this analysis of thirty-one cities in SSA. Four categories of household access to WS\&S were studied using data from demographic and health surveys \textendash{} these included: 1) household access to an improved water supply, 2) household's time spent collecting water, 3) household access to improved sanitation, and 4) households reporting to engage in open defecation. An exploratory analysis of these measures was then conducted to assess the relationship of access to several independent variables. Results: Among the 31 cities, there was wide variability in coverage levels and trends in coverage with respect to the four categories of access. The majority of cities were found to be increasing access in the categories of improved water supply and improved sanitation (65\% and 83\% of cities, respectively), while fewer were making progress in reducing the amount of time spent collecting water and reducing open defecation (50\% and 38\% of cities, respectively). Additionally, the prevalence of open defecation in study cities was found to be, on average, increasing. Conclusions: Based on DHS data, cities appeared to be making the most progress in gaining access to WS\&S along metrics which reflect specified targets of the Millennium Development Goals. Nearly half of the cities, however, did not make progress in reducing open defecation or the time spent collecting water. This may reflect that the MDGs have led to a focus on ``improved'' services while other measures, potentially more relevant to the extreme poor, are being neglected. This study highlights the need to better characterize access, beyond definitions of improved and unimproved, as well as the need to target resources to cities where changes in WS\&S access have stalled, or in some cases regressed.},

With this knowledge, we can understand real-world queries, developers' needs, and the query impact on the search results. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to understand what developers search on the web and what they find. We assess 1.3M queries to popular programming websites and we perform thousands of queries on Google to explore search results. We find that (i) developers' queries typically start with keywords (e.g., Python, Android, etc.), are short (3 words), tend to omit functional words, and are similar among each other; (ii) minor changes to queries do not largely affect the Google search results, however, some cosmetic changes may have a non-negligible impact; and (iii) search results are dominated by Stack Overflow, but YouTube is also a relevant source nowadays. We conclude by presenting detailed implications for researchers and developers.},

  abstract = {The demand for high quality recycled polymers in the European plastic industry is on the increase, likely due to the EU's Plastic Strategy intended to implement the circular economy model in this sector. The problem is that there is not enough recycled plastic in the market. In terms of volume, post-consumer plastic waste could be key to meet the current and future demand. Nevertheless, a high level of contamination originated during the product's life cycle restricts its use. The first step to change this must be identifying the undesired substances in post-consumer plastics and performing an effective risk assessment. The acquired knowledge will be fundamental for the development of innovative decontamination technologies. In this study, 134 substances including volatile and semi-volatile compounds have been identified in recycled LDPE and HDPE from domestic waste. Headspace and solvent extraction followed by GC/MS were used. The possible origin of each substance was studied. The main groups were additives, polymer and additives breakdown products, and contamination from external sources. The results suggest that recycled LDPE contains a broader number of additives and their degradation products. Some of them may cause safety concerns if reused in higher added value applications. Regarding recycled HDPE, the contaminants from the use phase are predominant creating problems such as intense odors. To reduce the number of undesired substances, it is proposed to narrow the variety of additives used in plastic manufacturing and to opt for separate waste collection systems to prevent cross-contamination with organic waste.},

Currently, an estimated 18,000 educators use GitHub in programming classrooms. Depending on how GitHub is implemented in the classroom, students may rely on GitHub for activities such as, submitting assignments, collaborating on group projects, and receiving feedback. Despite GitHub's growing presence in programming classrooms, to date, few studies have explored how GitHub and the design of its implementation shape students' learning outcomes and classroom experiences. Building on previous research, we investigated how students in classrooms that used GitHub (GitHub classrooms), as opposed to classrooms that did not use GitHub (non-GitHub classrooms), differed across key variables. We surveyed 7530 students and 300 educators from GitHub and non-GitHub classrooms. Overall, we found that using GitHub in the classroom predicted better learning outcomes and classroom experiences. For example, students felt more prepared for the future, and they felt a greater sense of belonging in the classroom and in the field. Importantly, the design of implementation affected learning outcomes. For example, of the students who used GitHub in the classroom and received instructor feedback, those who received (versus did not receive) feedback via GitHub benefited more from the feedback. We discuss best practices for maximizing benefits to student learning when implementing GitHub in the classroom, study limitations, and future research directions. Our research is a step towards understanding how GitHub, a tool with a growing presence in programming classrooms, impacts students' learning experiences.},

  abstract = {The Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) was a community-led, people-centred, demand-driven and incentivebased programme ideal to address India's rural sanitation crisis, or so it seemed. But policy failed to translate into practice and outcomes were remarkably poor. In the 2011 census data showed 31\% sanitation coverage in 2011 (up from 22\% in 2001), far from the 68\% reported by the Government. The decade has witnessed progress slowing down and the number of rural households without latrines increasing by 8.3 million. This article draws on evidence from two coordinated studies in four Indian states. It aims to explore the dichotomy of TSC policy and practice, its causes, and the potential of the new sanitation campaign, the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA). The study found that TSC implementation was unaligned with the programme's guiding principles. In reality the TSC was government-led, infrastructure-centred, subsidy-based and supply-led, leading to poor outcomes. The reasons behind the theory\textendash practice gap include low political priority; flawed monitoring; distorting accountability and career incentives; technocratic and paternalistic inertia; and corruption. In the new NBA, despite promising changes such as a stronger demand creation focus, key issues hampering implementation remain ignored. It is thus doomed to fail, burdened by known past hurdles.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to estimate the economic benefits and costs of a range of interventions to improve access to water supply and sanitation facilities in the developing world. Results are presented for eleven developing country WHO sub-regions as well as at the global level, in United States Dollars (US\$) for the year 2000. Five different types of water supply and sanitation improvement were modelled: achieving the water millennium development goal of reducing by half in 2015 those without improved water supply in the year 1990; achieving the combined water supply and sanitation MDG; universal basic access to water supply and sanitation; universal basic access plus water purification at the point-of-use; and regulated piped water supply and sewer connection. Predicted reductions in the incidence of diarrhoeal disease were calculated based on the expected population receiving these interventions. The costs of the interventions included estimations of the full investment and annual running costs. The benefits of the interventions included time savings due to easier access, gain in productive time and reduced health care costs saved due to less illness, and prevented deaths. The results show that all water and sanitation improvements are cost-beneficial in all developing world sub-regions. In developing regions, the return on a US\$1 investment was in the range US\$5 to US\$46, depending on the intervention. For the least developed regions, investing every US\$1 to meet the combined water supply and sanitation MDG lead to a return of at least US\$5 (AFR-D, AFR-E, SEAR-D) or US\$12 (AMR-B; EMR-B; WPR-B). The main contributor to economic benefits was time savings associated with better access to water and sanitation services, contributing at least 80\% to overall economic benefits. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that even under pessimistic data assumptions the potential economic benefits outweighed the costs in all developing world regions. Further country case-studies are recommended as a follow up to this global analysis.},

This study presents the economic efficiency (costs versus benefits) of sanitation interventions to better manage human excreta, from 47 field sites, covering six countries of Southeast Asia (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Vietnam). Costs were estimated in each location, while benefits (improved health, avoided water pollution, reduced sanitation access time, resource recovery) were estimated using evidence from published studies and field sites. The economic return per currency unit invested, known as the benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted were estimated. Across 25 rural field sites, pit latrines had a BCR of at least 5 in all countries, except Cambodia where the BCR was 2. In 22 urban field sites, septic tanks with wastewater management had a BCR of at least 2. Costs per DALY averted were found to be `cost-effective' for most sanitation interventions in all countries. Economic performance declined significantly when considering non-use of facilities by households or unused infrastructural capacity. However, the economic net returns were positive under all pessimistic scenarios examined in one-way sensitivity analysis. This study demonstrates that sanitation is a highly profitable social and economic investment in six Asian countries.},

Our results return broadly consistent willingness to pay estimates across the two methodologies and offers evidence that MSW sustainable management\textemdash a priority need in developing countries\textemdash may be addressed by positively enticing residents into a new fee-for-service program, but only where social benefits from such engagement are made clear. Interestingly, residents in lower urbanization grades, and those who have not previously sorted waste, reveal higher WTP values. Our results suggest that respondents are most interested in a wider selection of separated material options (i.e., recycled, organic and residual) as well as the potential for CO2 emission reductions associated with new waste management programs. We argue that the application of both stated preference techniques widens the set of policy input factors available to government officials and ensures~useful evidence for structuring future engagement programs to address those who retain a preference for the status quo.},

Using an instrumental variable (IV) approach, I examine whether the Containers and Packaging Recycling Law (CPRL), which includes policies such as subsidising recycling for municipalities and providing municipalities with recyclers, increases the domestic recycling volume of post-consumer plastic waste. The results show that the CPRL increases the recycling volume of plastic packaging waste by approximately 3.10~kg per capita and that of plastic bottles by 0.49~kg per capita. These increases are equivalent to a reduction of 2.6 million tons of CO2 emissions per year, saving US\$6.8 million in environmental costs. I also find evidence that these estimated impacts of the CPRL are larger than those of recycling policies aimed at households such as unit-based pricing and door-to-door collection. In contrast to previous studies, my results suggest that, in addition to policies promoting recycling in households, policies designed to encourage municipalities play an important role in the recycling of post-consumer plastic waste. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the heterogeneity of policy effects on emitters and processors in improving environmental outcomes.},

Methods: A contingent valuation study was undertaken in Matlab, Bangladesh in summer 2005. All respondents (N = 591) received a description of a cholera vaccine that was 50\% effective for 3 years and had negligible side effects. Respondents were asked how many vaccines they would purchase for their household at randomly pre-assigned prices. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the number of vaccines demanded and to calculate average WTP. Results: On average, respondents were willing to pay about US\$ 9.50 to purchase vaccines for all members of their household (i.e. US\$ 1.70 per vaccine). Average WTP per person is US\$ 2.40 for young children (1\textendash 4 years), US\$ 1.20 for school-age children, and US\$ 1.05 for adults. Median WTP estimates are significantly smaller: US\$ 1.00 for young children, US\$ 0.05 for schoolchildren, and US\$ 0 for adults. Conclusions: There is significant demand for cholera vaccines in Matlab at low prices. Recent herd protection research suggests that unvaccinated persons would also experience reduced incidence via indirect effects at low coverage rates associated with moderate vaccine prices.},

The term ``loess'' is an acronym for ``local regression'' and the entire procedure is a fairly direct generalization of traditional least-squares methods for data analysis. Loess is nonparametric in the sense that the fitting technique does not require an a priori specification of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Although it is used most frequently as a scatterplot smoother, loess can be generalized very easily to multivariate data; there are also inferential procedures for confidence intervals and other statistical tests. For all of these reasons, loess is a useful tool for data exploration and analysis in the social sciences. And, loess should be particularly helpful in the field of elections and voting behavior because theories often lead to expectations of nonlinear empirical relationships even though prior substantive considerations provide very little guidance about precise functional forms.},

  note = {Africa is experiencing unprecedented population growth with predictions that it will add 1.3 billion people to the planet by 2050 [13]. This is the equivalent of 3.5 million more people per month, or 80 additional people per minute, thus making Africa the biggest contributor to the future global population growth [13]. Furthermore, the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation are expected in the coastal zone with an estimated 49 million more people in low elevation coastal flood plains by 2060~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17305286#bib14}{[14]}. Alongside this rapid rate of urbanisation, Africa's growing middle class is creating large consumer markets for plastic goods and those packaged in plastic with supermarkets now replacing informal shops and markets~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17305286#bib15}{[15]}. Eighty percent of the continent's GDP is concentrated in just 11 African countries (Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Angola, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Kenya, Ghana and Libya) - all of which are have prominent coastlines~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17305286#bib15}{[15]}.
\par
The increasing trend in per~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/caput-consumption}{capita consumption}, urbanisation, and population growth is concerning when combined with a lack of sufficient infrastructure to manage the increased waste generation. Plastic waste presents not only an environmental issue for African countries but also a major socio-economic development challenge which impacts biodiversity, infrastructure, tourism and fisheries livelihoods},

Material flow analysis (MFA)~was performed on plastic packaging by life cycle. Based on the results in this study, material footprint of common single use plastics (i.e., PET water bottles, plastic cups, plastic bags, and plastic containers and cutlery by food delivery) by consumption was estimated to be on average 11.8~kg or 638 disposable plastics per capita a year, resulting in 32.6 billion disposable plastics and 603,000 ton of waste for disposal in South Korea. Approximately, 3 million ton of plastic packaging waste from household waste streams in 2017 in South Korea was generated and treated by energy recovery with solid refuse fuels and heat recovery, incineration without energy recovery, material recycling, and landfilling. Material recycling and recovery rates of plastic packaging waste from households were relatively low at 13.5\% and 50.5\%, respectively. It was estimated that as much as 3.6 million ton of CO2eq was generated from 2.7 million ton of plastic waste by incineration in 2017. Approximately 6.6 million ton CO2eq could be avoided by material recycling. Challenges and efforts have been discussed to improve current~recycling system~of~plastic packaging waste towards a circular economy.},

Our recent study, extensive discussions with executives, and on-site visits suggest that this wisdom may not be complete for certain industries or products. Customers on average return about 6\% of everything they buy. Companies need to view this as an opportunity to give this returns pile a new lease of life. Yet many companies are not used to thinking that the things they expel such as products, waste, and resources actually have value. In fact, few retailers and suppliers capture the wealth of information that is locked inside a box that has been returned to the warehouse. Elevating the returns process to a new marketing opportunity builds a loyal customer base and also attracts new ones. In this paper, we present a redefined value chain strategy that entails a closed-loop system for industries in which reverse chain activities (reuse, repair, refurbishing, recycling, remanufacturing, or redesign of returned products from the end user) may create additional competitive advantages for the firm. Firms that do not recognize the importance of an effective reverse logistics strategy as part of their value chain risk damaging customer relations and may seriously jeopardize their brand image and reputation. A good reverse logistics program can be a differentiator and provides a means of gaining market advantage. In our perspective, a redefined value chain should be a part of the overall business strategy for manufacturers or retailers who handle product returns.},

Using theories of power and hegemony, we investigate how the discourses of expert knowledge and formal waste management processes marginalize the discourses and practices of the informal waste sector. By analyzing these discourses and practices, we demonstrate how legitimate and authoritative knowledge is constructed. The analysis uncovered five themes that frame the dominant model of waste management in Sri Lanka: (a) the discourse of development, (b) expert systems, (c) political decision-making, (d) coercion and alienation, and (e) removal of waste. We demonstrate that small-scale informal waste management can be both a solution to Sri Lanka?s waste problem and a much needed income source for the poor. Thus, instead of alienation, coercion, and exclusion, informal waste workers should be recognized as valuable contributors of the urban wastescape to create a sustainable wastescape in the country.},

Building a latrine is the first step on the sanitation ladder in developing countries where a majority of the population defecates in open or public areas. Public health programs to improve sanitation have consistently framed promotional messages in terms of fecal\textendash oral disease prevention and largely fail to motivate changes in sanitation behavior. A qualitative consumer study using in-depth interviews with 40 household heads was carried out to explore the decision to install a pit latrine in rural Benin. The motives for installing a latrine are reported and variations across the interviews are examined. The paper asserts that at least one active drive (desire for change or dissatisfaction) from among 11 found is needed to motivate latrine adoption. Drives involved prestige, well-being, and situational goals. Health considerations played only a minor role, and had little if anything to do with preventing fecal\textendash oral disease transmission. Drives varied with gender, occupation, life stage, travel experience, education, and wealth, and reflected perceptions of the physical and social geography of the village, linked to availability of open defecation sites, social structure, road access, and urban proximity. The results have broad implications for new messages and strategies to promote sanitation in developing countries.},

Understanding demand for pit latrine fecal sludge management (FSM) services in these communities is important for designing demand-responsive sanitation services and policies to improve public health. We examine latrine emptying knowledge, attitudes, behavior, trends and rates of safe/unsafe emptying, and measure demand for a new hygienic latrine emptying service in unplanned communities in Dar Es Salaam (Dar), Tanzania, using data from a cross-sectional survey at 662 residential properties in 35 unplanned sub-wards across Dar, where 97\% had pit latrines. A picture emerges of expensive and poor FSM service options for latrine owners, resulting in widespread fecal sludge exposure that is likely to increase unless addressed. Households delay emptying as long as possible, use full pits beyond what is safe, face high costs even for unhygienic emptying, and resort to unsafe practices like `flooding out'. We measured strong interest in and willingness to pay (WTP) for the new pit emptying service at 96\% of residences; 57\% were WTP {$\geq$}U.S. \$17 to remove {$\geq$}200 L of sludge. Emerging policy recommendations for safe FSM in unplanned urban communities in Dar and elsewhere are discussed.},

BC sources in different seasons are quantified based on the Aethalometer model. The results indicate that the seasonal average BC concentration is 980\,{$\pm$}\,810\,ng/m3 (the average value\,{$\pm$}\,the standard deviation), 1062\,{$\pm$}\,986\,ng/m3, 1168\,{$\pm$}\,937\,ng/m3 and 2117\,{$\pm$}\,1549\,ng/m3 during spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. The source apportionment results reveal that liquid fuel (e.g., traffic) has higher seasonal contributions (ranging from 70\% in autumn to 84\% in winter) to total BC concentrations than solid fuels do (e.g., coal and biomass, ranging from 16\% in winter to 30\% in autumn). The relative contribution of liquid fuel to total BC concentrations was higher in winter and summer, whereas solid fuel has higher contributions in autumn and spring. The diurnal variations in total BC concentrations and the contributions of liquid fuel revealed a major increase during traffic rush hours in all seasons. However, solid fuel has higher contributions to total BC concentrations from 22:00\textendash 4:00, particularly during autumn. Meteorological parameters (wind speed and wind direction) provide supportive evidence from BC sources that BC emissions are mainly from local traffic sources and industry coal combustion in the southeast. Moreover, long-range transport from the southwestern regions (mainly Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan) of the sampling site also plays a role in total BC concentrations, especially in autumn and winter. The episodes of high BC concentrations under high wind speed in winter are caused by long-range transport from Hebei and Shandong Provinces. High BC in June is from biomass burning activities in the southeastern region of Nanjing and Zhejiang Province.},

  abstract = {Although plastic is one of the most commonly used materials in our everyday life, the current linear economy (`produce, use and dispose') engenders high risks to human health in relation to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental pollution. As a response to these challenges, the circular plastic economy is gaining momentum, where the goal is to reduce, reuse and recycle all plastic. The transition to the circular economy should be made across the entire plastics value chain in order to ensure circular design, production, use and waste management. This study examines the current scientific literature in relation to the entire value chain of plastics. This aim of the article is to provide an overview of the existing research (and highlight research gaps) associated with the transition of plastic use to a circular model. The literature was divided into the following categories: 1) design; 2) production; 3) use; 4) end-of-life; and 5) value chain. A high proportion of the literature was found to address the end-of-life phase, suggesting that the other phases are currently neglected. The results have implications that are applicable to multiple phases; in particular, contamination of waste streams and composite materials places significant limitations on the opportunity to recycle and reuse plastic in new products. This calls for changes in the whole value chain, and for trans-sectorial collaboration to ensure systemic transparency. Therefore, future research should take a holistic approach to the transition to circular through careful mapping of implications, stakeholder involvement and collaboration.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the multiple strategies articulated by grassroots recycler networks to bring about socioenvironmental change. The paper shows how these networks are an emblematic case of grassroots governmentality, whereby urban poor communities contribute to building more inclusive environmental regimes by developing technologies of power more typical of the powerful. These technologies include enumeration, with its resulting self-knowledge; the production of discourses and rationalities of social inclusion and environmental sustainability; and engagement in open and diverse alliances, at times with actors holding apparently antagonistic interests. The paper also reveals how recycling networks are a representative case of deep and green democracy. It is deep democracy, as grassroots networks strive to gain deep and true representativeness in their territories. It is green democracy, as it illustrates alternative pathways to environmental governance that is not limited to state and global organizations, but that also includes a range of control techniques emanating from the communities themselves.},

  abstract = {Object:  To analyse the framework within which the informal labour market operates and the social implications of this market by conducting a case study of sub-Saharan scrap metal waste pickers \textendash{}  chatarreros  \textendash{} in the city of Barcelona.   Design/methodology:  The study compares and contrast theoretical findings drawn from the literature about informal work and the social and living conditions of Barcelona's  chatarreros . Our primary data are collected from twelve interviews (ten with scrap metal waste pickers and two with neighbourhood leaders) and from ethnographic fieldwork conducted between February and August 2013.   Contributions / results:  Barcelona, in common with many other cities in the northern hemisphere, has experienced a growth in informal work directly linked to the tourism sector, the city's main economic activity. This growth was especially marked in the Great Recession (2008-2015). Traditionally, informal workers have been systematically ignored, recognition being saved solely for those legally or formally employed. But the major economic changes of the last 20 years have led to the transformation of labour markets and to the segmentation and precarisation of work, and with it the growth of the informal sector. Here, we analyse three elements that are critical for understanding this sector: recognition of work, its capitalisation and the relation between the individual and work.   Limitations:  This study, for reasons of space, limits itself to an examination of one group of informal workers in Barcelona, namely the  chatarreros ; however, there are many other groups that are worthy of study, including, the city's street vendors, and street artists: buskers, living statues, caricaturists, etc.   Originality/added value:  The study serves to fill the gap in knowledge regarding the reality of informal work and its social consequences. Specifically, it facilitates understanding of the theoretical concept of informality, illustrating, by means of a case study of informal recyclers or scrap metal waste pickers, the economic and social condition of informal immigrant workers characterised by poverty, discrimination, disembeddedness and subsistence.},

  abstract = {Waste' is everywhere, a common aspect of daily life in both the West and the Global South. However, the ways in which we as individuals understand it as a problem is far from universal. It does not exist independently from the people it affects, rather, waste, as a problem, is continually made and remade through human practice. The purpose of this article is to explore how and why certain `waste' items are and become understood as problems. We adopt Foucault's (1984) notion of `problematisa-tion', as an analytical lens for conceptualising processes of problem formation through the eyes of two different groups working within and on the margins of Mzedi Dump Site in Blantyre, Malawi: subsistence maize growers and informal waste pickers. Drawing on extensive qualitative and ethnographic fieldwork, our findings suggests that for those working at Mzedi, waste problematisations are shaped by the tangible: the visible, and often painful impacts that Mzedi's hazards have on their lives and livelihoods. However, the ultimate problematisation of waste lies in its utility, i.e. `good' waste, is internalised based on its value. `Bad' trash however, is problematised because it has no value, and is therefore considered useless, a problem taking up time and space that could be utilised more profit-ably. Understanding these processes of problem formation, and the degree to which waste problematisations are personal and/or socially constructed, has important ramifications for the adoption of appropriate waste management strategies and should inform a more nuanced and inclusive waste management studies discourse.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this comment is to call for more critical engagement with the potential and practice for biogas investment on the African continent. Over the past two decades, immense amounts of money have been spent by African governments, private individuals, and most conspicuously, international aid agencies and donors, on countless biogas projects in every country on the continent. Yet, despite the investments, biogas in African countries has not taken off, and the continent is strewn with the ruins of hundreds of failed and abandoned biogas projects. Moreover, scholarly literature contains little feedback about what actually happens on the ground. Drawing on this critical reading of the literature, including its blindspots on project outcomes and failures, and drawing on the authors' own extensive experience with small-scale biogas projects in Malawi and South Africa, this comment article calls for more scholarly critical reflection on why a biogas revolution, that has been perennially over the horizon, has yet to arrive while centring the role of social scientists to engage with biogas owners and operators to bridge the socio-technical divide from potential to practice.}

  abstract = {With the world's oceans in crisis, citizen knowledge and awareness around riverine and marine waste has become an increasingly crucial topic of study. For most investigations, spatial analysis has centered on the coastline, or most specifically the beach, i.e., the space where most respondents (urban, Northern, middle class), encounter marine litter. Yet, by focusing on the beach as the primary space of analysis, most studies have severely limited the scope of citizens they can engage, because in many African cities it is a space of exclusion. Moreover, for individuals further upstream, in spaces distant from the coast, what are their understandings of riverine and marine litter? What is their knowledge of the hydrological systems standing between them and the sea, and how do they see their ability to influence them? Drawing on extensive qualitative fieldwork in low-income, riverine adjacent communities in Durban, South Africa, and Blantyre, Malawi, the purpose of this article is to understand how Africa's urban poor experience and understand riverine and marine litter. The study utilises Foucault's notion of problematisations, and more recent adaptations of Foucault's work toward waste as a lens to conceptualise processes of problem formation: how individual respondents view riverine and marine litter as a problem. Findings suggest that problematisations around waste, in the community and in the hydrological system, are formed through daily experience and personal hardship; in the case of Blantyre, through the perceived impact waste can have on hydroelectricity generation, and in Johanna Road, by its contribution to flooding within the community. However, understandings of the marine environment and respondents' impact on the hydrological system, remain limited. Recommendations include rooting education and messaging around riverine and marine litter within low-income individuals' lived realities. However, any interventions targeted towards the poor must be accompanied by broader systemic change: improving access to solid waste management services and creating cleaner and more equitable communities.}

  abstract = {The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has generated an immense amount of potentially infectious waste, primarily face masks, which require rapid and sanitary disposal in order to mitigate the spread of the disease. Yet, within Africa, large segments of the population lack access to reliable municipal solid waste management (SWM) services, both complicating the disposal of hazardous waste, and public health efforts. Drawing on extensive qualitative fieldwork, including 96 semi-structured interviews, across four different low-income communities in Blantyre, Malawi and Durban, South Africa, the purpose of this article is to respond to a qualitative gap on mask disposal behaviours, particularly from within low-income and African contexts. Specifically, our purpose was to understand what behaviours have arisen over the past year, across the two disparate national contexts, and how they have been influenced by individual risk perceptions, established traditional practice, state communication, and other media sources. Findings suggest that the wearing of cloth masks simplifies disposal, as cloth masks can (with washing) be reused continuously. However, in communities where disposable masks are more prevalent, primarily within Blantyre, the pit latrine had been adopted as the most common space for `safe' disposal for a used mask. We argue that this is not a new behaviour, however, and that the pit latrine was already an essential part of many low-income households SWM systems, and that within the Global South, the pit latrine fulfils a valuable and uncounted solid waste management function, in addition to its sanitation role.},

This review examines the methodologies of previous studies to characterise the performance of low-cost air quality sensors and to identify the influential factors in sensor evaluation experiments. The data on four statistical measures (Correlation of Determination, r2; Root Mean Square Error, RMSE; Mean Normalised Bias, MNB; and Coefficient of Variation, CV) and details about five methodological factors in experimental design (environmental setting, reference instrument, regression model, pollutant attribute, and sensor original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specification) were extracted from a total of 112 primary articles for a detailed analysis. The results of the analysis suggested that low-cost air quality sensors exhibited improved r2 and RMSE in the experiments with stable environmental settings, in the comparison against non-designated reference instruments, or in the analysis where advanced regression models were used to adjust the sensor readings. However, the pollutant attribute and sensor OEM specification had inconclusive effects on r2 and RMSE due to contradictory results and lack of sufficient data. MNB and CV, two measures that US EPA recommends to determine the suitable application tier of air quality sensors, varied significantly among published experiments due to the discrepancy in experimental design. The outcomes of this work could provide direction to researchers regarding sensor evaluation experiments and guide practitioners to effectively select and deploy low-cost sensors for air quality monitoring.},

A fundamental question to be asked stems from the challenges of municipal service delivery. Why, in spite of the existence of regulatory and institutional frameworks, are municipalities still struggling to satisfy basic community needs such as water and electricity amongst others? All of government's official documents and contemporary literature reviewed, including the summative record of historical facts and narrative data, are evidence of the qualitative research design employed in this study. It is clearly articulated in this article that the existence of a local municipality with poor service~delivery is, amongst others, a direct consequence or manifestation of municipal capacity constraints, financial viability problems, service delivery protests, convoluted political process, corruption and poor planning as well as monitoring and evaluation challenges. In the main, the article accounts for why service delivery has failed to meet the expectations of the communities and thereby provide some possible propositions for consideration to attempt to bring a resolve to critical issues raised.},

Recently, Informal Waste Pickers (IWPs) have been incorporated into waste management cooperatives by formalizing their operations as a strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of waste management in such areas. This study was conducted in Zingwangwa, an unplanned settlement in Blantyre, Malawi, to understand whether the formalization of IWPs into cooperatives could be effective and/or accepted as a way of managing Municipal Solid Waste in unplanned urban settlements in Malawi. Thirty-four IWPs in Zingwangwa were identified and interviewed using a structured questionnaire; personnel from the Blantyre City Council and middlemen were interviewed as key informants. We determined that IWPs experience challenges in all dimensions of their lives: low material prices with exploitative price fluctuations, negative public perception and a lack of transportation are a few of their struggles. Furthermore, a fear of decreased income, conflicts during proceeds sharing, free riding behaviors and an attachment to their independence mean that IWPs are unlikely to form a cooperative on their own though some would be willing to join if a third party initiated the formalization process.},

Findings suggest that informal collectors play a substantial role in the first stage \textendash{} collecting solid waste from the households, notably from poorer segments of the population. This is not the `dualist' aspect of poor earnings but actually made possible by them escaping control on where to deposit the waste. Employing a simple technology, and bringing the waste no farther than the nearest unofficial `collection point', they provide services at low cost to the households, but much less so to the community (environmentally of little use). If public provisions can be made for the second stage in waste collection, this may trigger even more supply of small-scale collecting services, a combination that may prove cost effective.},

In many parts of the country especially in rural areas girls are not prepared and aware about menstruation so they face many difficulties and challenges at home, schools, and work places. While reviewing literature, we found that little, inaccurate, or incomplete knowledge about menstruation is a great hindrance in the path of personal and menstrual hygiene management. Girls and women have very less or no knowledge about reproductive tract infections caused due to ignorance of personal hygiene during menstruation time. In rural areas, women do not have access to sanitary products or they know very little about the types and method of using them or are unable to afford such products due to high cost. So, they mostly rely on reusable cloth pads which they wash and use again. Needs and requirements of the adolescent girls and women are ignored despite the fact that there are major developments in the area of water and sanitation. Women manage menstruation differently when they are at home or outside; at homes, they dispose of menstrual products in domestic wastes and in public toilets and they flush them in the toilets without knowing the consequences of choking. So, there should be a need to educate and make them aware about the environmental pollution and health hazards associated with them. Implementation of modern techniques like incineration can help to reduce the waste. Also, awareness should be created to emphasize the use of reusable sanitary products or the natural sanitary products made from materials like banana fibre, bamboo fibre, sea sponges, water hyacinth, and so on.},

  abstract = {Reverse Logistics and Closed Loop Supply Chain Management (RL\&CLSCM) are universally recognised as two environmentally friendly practices that could help in greening conventional supply chains. The popularity of these fields of research has led to the evolution of a vast number of publications in the literature. Various journals have so far contributed to the advancement of the field, with the International Journal of Production of Research (IJPR) being one of the most prominent contributed journals. To celebrate the 55th volume anniversary of IJPR, this review study aims to investigate the studies in the area of RL\&CLSCM published in IJPR. The paper presents a thorough bibliometric and content analysis of 94 studies that were published in IJPR from 2000 until July 2017. The studies initially underwent a rigorous bibliometric and mapping analysis that helped to identify their characteristics. Subsequently, the contents of the sample papers were evaluated thoroughly. The content analysis led to classification of the papers into two main categories and sub-categories, and then to rigorous identification of the papers' attributes. The bibliometric and content analysis disclosed several research gaps that remain to be addressed in IJPR.},

Quantifying an individual's willingness to pay (WTP) is important for promoting solid waste management and disposal. However, there is still lack of a review of the application of CVM in the field of environmental science. This study provides a systematic review of the application of CVM in solid waste management and disposal, to understand the research status and future development, and to identify the key influence factors on an individual's WTP values. Most studies have focused on five kinds of typical solid waste (construction and demolition waste, e-waste, agricultural waste, plastic waste, and municipal solid waste) and on solid waste management service. In designing the CVM questionnaire, the sample size, elicitation technology (e.g., double-bounded dichotomous choice), and survey method (e.g., face-to-face interview) were considered, to improve the CVM reliability. The results indicate that personal information (especially educational level, age, and income level), individual attitudes and perceived behavioral control were often the significant factors for residents' WTP. This study also discloses the distribution of existing studies (mainly focused on Asia) and development from the perspective of spatial and temporal distribution (diversification of research subjects), analyzes the urban-rural disparities and discusses the correlation between WTP/WTP values and regions with different economic levels. The study provides scholars with suggested questionnaire design methods and experiences, and provides policymakers with breakthrough points for improving solid waste management, through which a zero-waste city development model can be better constructed.},

The present study was carried out in the city of Algiers, the capital city of Algeria. This urban area is marked by an increase in waste flow combined with a demographic surge. In order to investigate waste production and its drivers, we used both multiple regression and correlation analyses to test this dependence. Geospatial analysis was performed using principal component analysis integrated with GIS in order to look at the spatial distribution of waste management and potential drivers of waste production. The results indicate that household waste management is influenced by drivers related to the size of the settlement and the characteristics of waste management companies (p {$\leq$} 0.05). The findings also show that none of the sociodemographic variables were found to significantly influence waste production. However, the spatial distribution is influenced by the geographic and sociodemographic characteristics of Algeria at all territorial levels. Algiers is still a landfill-based city in the MENA region, where mixed waste collection prevails in all districts. This study reinforces the importance of expanding source-separated waste collection schemes in order to increase the household waste diversion from landfills and, more importantly, shows how modern tools such as GIS, principal component analysis, and spatial analysis urban planning are useful for monitoring household waste, in line with circular economy principles.},

However, due to many inhibiting factors, these resources are under-utilised. This article reviews commercial biogas systems that treat organic waste from municipalities, large livestock farms, large plantations/crop farms, food/beverage production facilities, and other industries, to identify essential lessons which African countries could use to develop/disseminate such biogas systems. The review identified the critical barriers to commercial biogas development to be high initial capital costs, weak environmental policies, poor institutional framework, poor infrastructure and a general lack of willpower to implement renewable energy policies and set challenging targets. In African countries where feed-in-tariffs, quota obligations and competitive bidding programmes have been instituted, implementation has been poor, and most state-owned utilities have been unsupportive. Using knowledge from more experienced countries such as Germany and China, some key lessons have were identified. Among the key lessons is the need to institute and enforce environmental management policies to ensure that waste from medium and large livestock farms and industries are not disposed of indiscriminately, a tool China has recently used to promote commercial biogas plants to a high degree of success.},

The extent to which other ideas, such as the sanitation value chain, have increasingly been incorporated into planning approaches is discussed and some of the challenges affecting successful urban sanitation which lie outside of planning are considered.

  abstract = {Monetary valuation of ecosystem services enables more accurate accounting of the environmental costs and benefits of policies, but this has rarely been applied in developing countries. In such contexts, there are particular methodological and epistemological challenges that require novel valuation methodologies. This paper introduces a new participatory, deliberative choice experiment approach conducted in the Solomon Islands. The research aimed to determine the value people placed on ecosystem services and whether participatory interventions to elicit deeper held values influenced the preferences expressed. Results found that the initial willingness to pay for a number of tropical forest ecosystem services amounted to 30\% of household income. Following deliberative intervention exercises, key ecosystem services effectively became priceless as participants were unwilling to trade them off in the choice experiment scenarios, regardless of financial cost. The group based deliberative approach, combined with participatory interventions, also resulted in significant learning for participants. This included a more sophisticated view of ecological-cultural linkages, greater recognition of deeper held values, and greater awareness of the consequences of human actions for the environment. The use of a group-based participatory approach instead of a conventional individual survey helped to overcome many of the practical difficulties associated with valuation in developing countries. Given the impact of learning on valuation outcomes, participation and deliberation should be integrated into valuation of any complex good, both in developing and developed economies. However, such a methodology raises questions about how valuation can deal with unwillingness to trade-off key ecosystem services, which results in the breakdown of monetary valuation methods. Evaluation of the appropriateness of valuation processes and methodologies for assessing deeper held values and use of mixed-method approaches will be essential to ensure policies take into account the extent to which human life is dependent on ecosystem services.},

Due to the limited number of central ozone monitors and varying personal behavioral patterns, some level of variability between ambient and personal exposures is expected. Low-cost sensors and different ways to capture personal activity patterns are being developed as an effort to improve the accuracy of exposure assessment. However, it is still most common to use the traditional approach of using unadjusted ambient concentrations as surrogates for personal exposures. To our knowledge, there has not been a meta-analysis that summarizes the findings from studies that investigated the differences between personal and ambient ozone. We conducted a literature search in PubMed and Science Direct for peer-reviewed studies reporting at least one of the following in a numeric format: 1) personal-ambient measurements, 2) personal-ambient slopes, or 3) personal-ambient correlations to identify and summarize existing studies that investigated personal and ambient ozone concentrations. Twenty-two articles met inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Ambient concentrations almost always overestimated personal exposures. A meta-analysis of slopes showed an overall personal-ambient slope of 0.21 (95\% CI: 0.15, 0.27) with high hetero\- geneity (97\%) across studies. The correlations between personal and ambient ozone varied drama\- tically across subjects from a strong positive (0.77) to a moderate negative correlation (-0.43). Our study found that ambient measurements are not accurate representations of personal exposure, while the magnitude of exposure measurement error varied across studies. Different sources of ozone and how they contribute to true exposure levels for individuals in complementary ways need to be better addressed. The effort to better understand the impact of traditional exposure assess\- ment on the risk estimates must be emphasized along with efforts to improve the current exposure assessment approaches to provide context for interpreting the results from ozone epidemiological studies.},

The Kansas City Transportation and Local-Scale Air Quality Study (KC-TRAQS), conducted over a 1-year period, researched emissions source characterization in the Argentine, Turner, and Armourdale, Kansas (KS) neighborhoods and the broader southeast Kansas City, KS area. This area is characterized as a near-source environment with impacts from large railyard operations, major roadways, and commercial and industrial facilities. The spatial and meteorological effects of particulate matter less than 2.5 \textmu m (PM2.5), and black carbon (BC) pollutants on potential population exposures were evaluated at multiple sites using a combination of regulatory grade methods and instrumentation, low-cost sensors, citizen science, and mobile monitoring. The initial analysis of a subset of these data showed that mean reference grade PM2.5 concentrations (gravimetric) across all sites ranged from 7.92 to 9.34 \textmu g/m3. Mean PM2.5 concentrations from low-cost sensors ranged from 3.30 to 5.94 \textmu g/m3 (raw, uncorrected data). Pollution wind rose plots suggest that the sites are impacted by higher PM2.5 and BC concentrations when the winds originate near known source locations. Initial data analysis indicated that the observed PM2.5 and BC concentrations are driven by multiple air pollutant sources and meteorological effects. The KC-TRAQS overview and preliminary data analysis presented will provide a framework for forthcoming papers that will further characterize emission source attributions and estimate near-source exposures. This information will ultimately inform and clarify the extent and impact of air pollutants in the Kansas City area.},

The results showed that the human scavengers consider waste picking as a full-time employment and not as a transitory form of urban employment. Also, the scavengers live in residential areas and not in squatter villages around the landfill. Scavengers' exposure to flies is noted to be relatively high. The respondents do not engage in fierce competition involving pushing one another and that they often leave the collected items on the landfill without the concern of having the materials stolen. The relatively high level of trust among the scavengers can serve as a spring board for establishing scavengers' cooperatives.}

Methods include participant observation, structured interviews, questionnaire application, and greenhouse gas accounting of recycling using a Clean Development Mechanism methodology. The results show that recycling cooperatives can achieve important energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and suggest there is an opportunity for Cooperpires and other similar recycling groups to participate in the carbon credit market.

Equally limiting, the workflows that lead to research results are rarely published in a reproducible, reusable, and easy-to-understand fashion for others. Information and communication technologies widely used in commercial and government programs are growing in relevance for international global development professionals and offer a potential towards better data and workflow sharing. However, the technical and custom nature of many data management systems limits their accessibility to non-ICT professionals. The authors propose an end-to-end data collection, management, and dissemination platform designed for use by global development program managers and researchers. The system leverages smartphones, cellular based sensors, and cloud storage and computing to lower the entry barrier to impact evaluation.},

  abstract = {The wavelength dependence of light absorption by aerosols collected on filters is investigated throughout the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral region. Measurements were made using an optical transmission method. Aerosols produced by biomass combustion, including wood and savanna burning, and by motor vehicles, including diesel trucks, are included in the analysis. These aerosol types were distinguished by different wavelength ({$\lambda$}) dependences in light absorption. Light absorption by the motor vehicle aerosols exhibited relatively weak wavelength dependence; absorption varied approximately as {$\lambda-$}1, indicating that black carbon (BC) was the dominant absorbing aerosol component. By contrast, the biomass smoke aerosols had much stronger wavelength dependence, approximately {$\lambda-$}2. The stronger spectral dependence was the result of enhanced light absorption at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm and was largely reduced when much of the sample organic carbon (OC) was extracted by dissolution in acetone. This indicates that OC in addition to BC in the biomass smoke aerosols contributed significantly to measured light absorption in the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions and that OC in biomass burning aerosols may appreciably absorb solar radiation. Estimated absorption efficiencies and imaginary refractive indices are presented for the OC extracted from biomass burning samples and the BC in motor vehicle-dominated aerosol samples. The uncertainty of these constants is discussed. Overall, results of this investigation show that low-temperature, incomplete combustion processes, including biomass burning, can produce light-absorbing aerosols that exhibit much stronger spectral dependence than high-temperature combustion processes, such as diesel combustion.},

  abstract = {Introduction Informal waste recyclers contribute significantly to waste removal in South Africa. Waste recyclers face health hazards which are associated with handling and disposal of waste, a lack of personal protective wear and inaccessibility to occupational health care services. Consequently, accessing health care within the public health care sector is important for health outcomes in this population. This study assesses health care access of informal waste recyclers in South Africa to establish baseline information for health planning for potential inclusion of informal waste recyclers into occupational health services.   Methods A cross-sectional study of informal waste recyclers in two landfill sites in Johannesburg was conducted from March 2018. A standardized structured questionnaire was used to collect information on sociodemographic details, health care utilization, barriers to access and acceptability and affordability of health care. Factors associated with health care utilization were assessed using logistic regression.   Results A total of 363 informal waste recyclers were included in the study. Less than half of informal waste recyclers (41.0\%) used health care facilities in the last 12 months. Those who accessed services chose to use facilities close to where they live (87.0\%). Barriers to accessing health care services included long waiting periods (36.6\%), being unable to take time off work (26.3\%) and transport problems (13\%). In the univariate analysis, factors such as gender and being treated well at the clinic and location of the health care facility were associated with health care utilization (OR: 1.97, p = 0.05, OR: 1.94, p = 0.02, OR: 0.65, p = 0.04 respectively).   Conclusion Informal waste recyclers face numerous challenges to accessing health care. Specific to their informal trade, barriers to health care utilization are related to financial repercussions due to the informal nature of their work.}

A between-subject design was used to analyze the effectiveness of indirect questioning in addressing issues of social desirability bias as well as the effects of information on consumer behavior. Consumer WTP for packaging material was highest for plastic packaging, followed by glass, carton and aluminum. Our empirical analysis reveals that indirect questioning results in WTP values for packaging recyclability that are 60\% lower than those obtained from direct questioning. We find that information from a video treatment had a significant and positive effect on consumer preferences and demand for packaging recyclability. Our results suggest that more scrutiny should be placed on studies that do not address social desirability bias when evaluating recycling behavior.},

In order to address differences in public preferences between the rural and urban hydropower projects a split-sample test is conducted. The results of this test show that preferences differ. Generally people have a positive attitude towards new hydropower plants. The provision of green electricity as well as the extension of recreational activities are valued positively and therefore exhibit a positive willingness to pay. However the realisation of a new hydropower plant must come with a small environmental impact in order to gain a significant welfare increasing impact.},

To obtain realistic proportions of the building classes that are prevalent in Malawi, a building survey was conducted in Central and Southern Malawi between 10th and 20th July 2017. The results from the survey are used to modify the PAGER-based proportions of main housing typologies by reflecting actual housing construction in the surveyed areas. The results clearly highlight the importance of using realistic building stock data for seismic risk assessment in Malawi; relying on global building stock information can result in significant bias of earthquake impact assessment.},

As a result, recycling companies in South Korea are refusing to collect recyclable waste, which caused a solid waste management crisis in April 2018. Due to this crisis, many people are unable to discard their recyclable waste. This study aims to assess the economic value of a sustainable recycling and waste management policy to solve the waste management crisis. The analysis in this study is divided into two parts: The first part estimates the inconvenience costs to residents using a contingent valuation method, whereas the second part analyzes the preferences for a new policy using a mixed logit model with a choice experiment. The results show that mean willingness to pay (WTP) per household is 41,234 (USD 36.96) KRW/year; the total WTP would be able to increase the total disposal capacity by up to 4.51\%. In addition, at an adequate price level for the policy alternative, the policy acceptance rate suggests that the price of biodegradable volume-rate disposal bags should increase by no more than KRW 66 (USD 0.06) per bag. This study provides guidance to policy makers who wish to consider both validity and acceptability.},

  abstract = {The population of Lagos, the largest city in Nigeria, increased seven times from 1950 to 1980 with a current population of over 10 million inhabitants. The majority of the city's residents are poor. The residents make a heavy demand on resources and, at the same time, generate large quantities of solid waste. Approximately 4 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) is generated annually in the city, including approximately 0.5 million of untreated industrial waste. This is approximately 1.1kg/cap/day. Efforts by the various waste management agencies set up by the state government to keep its streets and neighborhoods clean have achieved only minimal success. This is because more than half of these wastes are left uncollected from the streets and the various locations due to the inadequacy and inefficiency of the waste management system. Whilst the benefits of proper solid waste management (SWM), such as increased revenues for municipal bodies, higher productivity rate, improved sanitation standards and better health conditions, cannot be overemphasized, it is important that there is a reduction in the quantity of recoverable materials in residential and commercial waste streams to minimize the problem of MSW disposal. This paper examines the status of recovery and recycling in current waste management practice in Lagos, Nigeria. Existing recovery and recycling patterns, recovery and recycling technologies, approaches to materials recycling, and the types of materials recovered from MSW are reviewed. Based on these, strategies for improving recovery and recycling practices in the management of MSW in Lagos, Nigeria are suggested.}

I draw on evidence collected during 20~months of ethnographic research in Delhi, focusing on participant observation with informal collectors during their neighborhood routes and interviews with 50 informal collectors. Bringing together political and urban sociology, postcolonial urban studies, and institutional theory, the paper frames competition over city garbage and recycling as a relational matter. I argue that informal workers preserved their jurisdiction through practical legitimation, depending on everyday actions and social expectations rather than explicit laws or beliefs to secure legitimacy. I demonstrate how status-based relations, here based on caste and labor migration, can confer legitimacy and provide a source of regulation, as actors set out and meet implicit expectations for appropriate actions, relationships, and social boundaries.}

For open research to become the norm, initiatives should engage academics from all career stages, particularly senior academics (namely senior lecturers, readers, professors) given their routine involvement in determining the quality of research.

Given that\textemdash like all researchers\textemdash senior academics are motivated by self-interest, this paper lays out three feasible steps that senior academics can take to improve the quality and productivity of their research, that also serve to engender open research.

  abstract = {A ``poverty trap'' can be understood as a set of self-reinforcing mechanisms whereby countries start poor and remain poor: poverty begets poverty, so that current poverty is itself a direct cause of poverty in the future. The idea of a poverty trap has this striking implication for policy: much poverty is needless, in the sense that a different equilibrium is possible and one-time policy efforts to break the poverty trap may have lasting effects. But what does the modern evidence suggest about the extent to which poverty traps exist in practice and the underlying mechanisms that may be involved? The main mechanisms we examine include S-shaped savings functions at the country level; ``big-push'' theories of development based on coordination failures; hunger-based traps which rely on physical work capacity rising nonlinearly with food intake at low levels; and occupational poverty traps whereby poor individuals who start businesses that are too small will be trapped earning subsistence returns. We conclude that these types of poverty traps are rare and largely limited to remote or otherwise disadvantaged areas. We discuss behavioral poverty traps as a recent area of research, and geographic poverty traps as the most likely form of a trap. The resulting policy prescriptions are quite different from the calls for a big push in aid or an expansion of microfinance. The more-likely poverty traps call for action in less-traditional policy areas such as promoting more migration.},

Mean ({$\pm$} standard deviation) BC concentration (1.48~{$\pm~$}1.40~{$\mu$}g~m-3) at the fixed sites of the neighborhood was lower than downtown, while PM2.5 (9.68~{$\pm~$}8.40~{$\mu$}g~m-3) concentration was higher. The mobile monitoring showed higher mean PM2.5 concentrations but lower BC/PM2.5 ratios than downtown, with sharp and fast spikes (up to 317.87 and 565.21~{$\mu$}g~m-3 for BC and PM2.5, respectively). The large spatial heterogeneity of particulate concentrations was associated with the occurrence of MSW burning events. Our observations were verified by the survey respondents who identified poor waste management practices: garbage in streets, waste burning, and illegal dump sites. Even though the area has a municipal waste collection service, the majority of the respondents (87\%) had seen waste burning close to their homes on a weekly basis, and think that people burn waste out of habit (54\%) and because they are not patient to wait for the collection services (67\%). To combat this illegal practice, we suggest raising the public awareness through campaigns at local level, adopting education initiatives and economic incentives for correct waste segregation, and enforcing regular inspection of burning events by the authorities. Our research method proved to be a time- and cost-effective approach for mapping particulate concentrations and for identifying undesirable waste practices, and could be effectively applied to other global cities.},

An on-field analysis was conducted by random and incidental sampling method of questionnaire administration followed by observation. Among the respondents (n?=?178), 79\% of individuals were waste pickers, 15\% were small-scale waste collectors, and 6\% were medium-scale waste collectors. The majority of the waste pickers sampled are male (79\%). The amount of waste collected by individual waste pickers is 43.87?kg?person?1?day?1, a corresponding recycling rate of approximately 12\%, and an average monthly income of US\$91.7. Gender differences are apparent as the male waste pickers generated higher incomes than those earned by their female counterparts (US\$128.3 for men and US\$69.7 for women) even as their average work hours are similar to that of the men (7.8 and 7.6?hours?day?1, respectively). Economic motives are the respondents? primary driving factors as moving to large cities accompanied by their family members. The study concluded that the IRS plays substantial contribution to waste management; further integrating them into the waste management system via IRS association, additional investment, formulation of law and policies and efforts by municipalities can give various benefits for involved stakeholders, the community and the environment. The results can serve as a significant reference for improving the solid waste recycling system and informal sector management in Indonesian cities and other developing countries.},

In order to develop proper policies for renewable energy investment, it is necessary to analyze the benefits of renewable energy investment based on households' willingness to pay. This study attempts to apply a choice experiment (CE) for assessing renewable energy investment in Korea. Moreover, we employ a multinomial probit (MNP) model to relax the assumption that all respondents have the same preferences for the attributes being valued, which is usually required in empirical CE studies. An MNP model allows the most flexible pattern of error correlation structure. The results reveal that the Korean public puts a value on the protection of wildlife, reduction of pollution, and increased employment opportunities. On the other hand, respondents do not derive significant values from the improvement of landscapes. This study is expected to provide policy-makers with useful information for evaluating and planning policies related to renewable energy investment.},

Previous studies suggested that it is essential that MSWM policy adapts to local contexts and situations in its implementation. In Indonesia, neighborhood associations exist to enhance cooperation among community members. Community-based recycling activities called waste banks (WBs) in Indonesia utilize the functions of neighborhood associations. This study analyzed how local governments supported community-based WB programs and examined the institutional mechanism of the central WB which was established as part of the community-based WB integration to the city's MSWM policy in Makassar, Indonesia. Through a desk study and semi-structured interviews with key actors in community-based WBs, it was found that the local government's major intervention was the establishment of a mayor's regulation to set up a central WB using the municipal budget to facilitate waste transaction between community-based WBs and recyclers. The institutional framework of the central WB and the functions performed by the central WB, such as recyclable waste collection from community-based WBs and market price analysis on recyclable waste, were clarified through this study.}

Understanding the existing patterns of plastic waste generation and recycling is essential for effective management planning. The present study established a relationship between plastic waste generation rate and the identified socioeconomic groups, higher socioeconomic group (HSEG), middle socioeconomic group (MSEG), and lower socioeconomic group (LSEG) of the study area (Dhanbad, India). For identification of the socioeconomic groups, four different socioeconomic parameters were considered (total family income, education, occupation and type of houses). The information related to the identified parameters were obtained using questionnaire survey conducted in the selected households. One week plastic waste sampling was carried out in the households of all the socioeconomic groups. The plastic waste generated in the study area was 5.7\% of the total municipal solid waste. In terms of total plastic waste generation rate, it was found that HSEG had maximum (51\,g/c/d) and LSEG had minimum (8\,g/c/d) generation rate. The present study area does not have any formal waste recycling system. Thus, the amount of plastic waste recovered and the revenue generated from recycling of plastic waste by the active informal recyclers (waste pickers, itinerant waste buyers and scrap dealers) in the study area have been evaluated. Additionally, three non-linear machine learning models i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) have been developed and compared for the prediction of plastic waste generation rate.},

Lack of awareness about environmental impact of open burning, and ignorance of the fact, i.e. `Open burning is a source of emission of carcinogenic substances' are major hindrances towards an appropriate municipal solid waste management system in India. The paper highlights the open burning of MSW practices in India, and the current and projected emission of 10 major pollutants (dioxin, furans, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and 1-hexene) emitted due to the open burning of MSW. Waste to Energy potential of MSW was also estimated adopting effective biological and thermal techniques. Statistical techniques were applied to analyse the data and current and projected emission of various pollutants were estimated. Data pertaining to population, MSW generation and its collection efficiency were compiled for 29 States and 7 Union Territories. Thereafter, emission of 10 pollutants was measured following methodology prescribed in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 2006. The study revealed that people living in Metropolitan cities are more affected by emissions from open burning.},

  abstract = {Background: While the sanitation ladder is useful in analysing progressive improvements in sanitation, studies in Uganda have not indicated the sanitation barriers faced by the urban poor. There are various challenges in shared latrine use, cleaning and maintenance. Results from Kampala city indicate that, failure to clean and maintain sanitation infrastructure can lead to a reversal of the potential benefits that come with various sanitation facilities. Methods: A cross sectional qualitative study was conducted between March and May 2013. Data were collected through 18 focus group discussions (FGDs) held separately; one with women, men and youth respectively. We also used pictorial methods; in addition, 16 key informant interviews were conducted. Data were analysed using content thematic approach. Relevant quotations per thematic area were identified and have been used in the presentation of the results. Results: Whether a shared sanitation facility was improved or not, it was abandoned once it was not properly used and cleaned. The problem of using shared latrines began with the lack of proper latrine training when people do not know how to squat on the latrine hole. The constrained access and security concerns, obscure paths that were filthy especially at night, lack of light in the latrine cubicle, raised latrines sometimes up to two metres above the ground, coupled with lack of cleaning and emptying the shared facilities only made a bad situation worse. In this way, open defecation gradually substituted use of the available sanitation facilities. This paper argues that, filthy latrines have the same net effect as crude open defection. Conclusion: Whereas most sanitation campaigns are geared towards provision of improved sanitation infrastructure, these findings show that mere provision of infrastructure (improved or not) without adequate emphasis on proper use, cleaning and maintenance triggers an involuntary descent off the sanitation ladder. Understanding this reversal movement is critical in sustainable sanitation services and should be a concern for all actors.},

Yet, significant efforts in improving the environmental awareness and sustainability of the construction sector are arising through the introduction of the numerous regulations, directives, and initiatives. This review work provides an overview of the most relevant existing European policies and legislation for the built environment, and the construction materials in particular. The implementation of a comparative assessment against the key elements of the international legislation and efforts enables the definition of the responsiveness of the EU in enacting policies that ensure the environmental sustainability of the sector, as well as identifies prospects for further improvement. Working towards the increase of the sustainability of the construction sector in a framework of holistic life cycle considerations is promoted in the current legislation, where identifying opportunities for energy and cost savings, utilizing natural resources efficiently and achieving waste minimization is endorsed. This work can be exploited from both policy- makers and the scientific community as guidance for transforming in a truly green sustainable construction market. The conclusions of this work indicate that the sustainability of the built environment will come through the increased use of alternative, recycled, natural and unconventional construction materials and thermal insulation materials, the exploitation of prefabricated building elements, the integration of LCA with BIM, the employment of multi- objective optimization methodologies, and the development of country- specific data for the implementation of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. These fields, as well as other factors such as globilisation and government intervention, are critical for fulfilling the vision of the European Union (EU) and will require systematic approach for their incorporation in the relevant policies to be developed and introduced in the near future.},

This attribution method contains assumptions with uncertainties that have not been formally assessed. We show that the potential range of AAE for BC\textsubscript{Ext} (or BC\textsubscript{Int}) in the atmosphere can reasonably lead to +7\% to -22\% uncertainty in BC\textsubscript{Ext} (or BC\textsubscript{Int}) absorption at short wavelengths derived from measurements made at longer wavelengths, where BrC is assumed not to absorb light. These uncertainties propagate to errors in the attributed absorption of BrC. For uncertainty in attributed BrC absorption to be \&le; {$\pm$} 33\%, 23\% to 41\% of total absorption must be sourced from BrC. These uncertainties would be larger if absorption by dust were also to be considered due to additional AAE assumptions. For data collected during a biomass-burning event, the mean difference between measured and AAE attributed BrC absorption was found to be 34\% \&ndash; an additional uncertainty in addition to the theoretical uncertainties presented. In light of the potential for introducing significant and poorly constrained errors, we caution against the universal application of the AAE method for attributing BrC absorption.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The application of stated preference methods rests on the assumption that respondents act rationally and that their demand for the non-market good on the hypothetical market is equal to what their real demand would be. Previous studies have shown that this is not the case and this gap is known as hypothetical bias. The present paper attempts to frame the description of the hypothetical market so as to induce more ``true market behaviour'' in the respondents by including a short Cheap Talk script. The script informs respondents that in similar studies using stated preference methods, people have a tendency to overestimate how much they are willing to pay compared to their actual (true) willingness to pay. Applying a two-split sample approach to a Choice Experiment study focusing on preferences for reducing visual disamenities from offshore wind farms, the Cheap Talk script is found to be a preference mover, but does not affect preferences significantly. Significant effects are found when relating the effect of the Cheap Talk script to the cost levels of the alternatives, in that female respondents are found to choose higher cost alternatives less frequently when presented with the Cheap Talk script, while male respondents are not affected.},

The urine samples were obtained from urine diverting toilets installed in different households situated at Siddhipur, Nepal. Urine samples so obtained were all stored in air tight plastic drum for a period of several weeks to several months prior to sampling time. The pH of urine was in the range of 8.8 to 9.0. Number of bacteria per 100 ml of urine was calculated. Enumeration was done by taking an average count of three plates. Total of five samples were analyzed. Enterococcus spp was isolated from all the samples, the highest number being 2500 and the lowest being 200 with the average of 1250. On the other hand E. coli was found to be absent in all of the samples. The result obtained suggests that gram negative E. coli had a rapid die-off rate as compared to gram positive Enterococcus spp.},

The water sector provides a useful perspective in which to evaluate the use of this strategy because it has been subject to quantitative target setting since 1976. We critically analyze two early periods of target setting together with their most recent incarnation in the Millennium Development Goals. In so doing, we identify two stories concerning the utility of such a turn to metrics: the first is a perennial and at times justified optimism in target setting, and the second is a more cautionary tale about the dangers of measurement and its tendency to gloss over challenging but significant issues. In addition, we offer some brief conclusions on the implications for the post-2015 agenda and some potential measurement alternatives.},

  abstract = {Increasing plastic recycling rates is crucial to tackle plastic pollution and reduce consumption of fossil resources. Recycling routes for post-consumer plastic fractions that are technologically and economically feasible remain a challenge. Profitable value chains for recycling mixed film and tray-like plastics have hardly been implemented today, in sharp contrast to recycling of relatively pure fractions such as polyethylene terephthalate and high-density polyethylene bottles. This study examines the economic feasibility of implementing mechanical recycling for plastic waste such as polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene films and mixed polyolefins. In most European countries these plastic fractions are usually incinerated or landfilled whilst in fact technologies exist to mechanically recycle them into regranulates or regrinds. Results show that the economic incentives for the recycling of plastic packaging depend predominantly on the product price and product yield. At current price levels, the most profitable plastic fraction to be recycled is PS rigids, with an internal rate of return of 14\%, whereas the least profitable feed is a mixed polyolefin fraction with a negative internal rate of return in a scenario with steadily rising oil prices. Moreover, these values would be substantially reduced if oil prices, and therefore plastic product prices decrease. Considering a discount rate of 15\% for a 15-year period, mechanical recycling is not profitable if no policy changes would be imposed by governments. Clearly low oil prices may jeopardize the mechanical recycling industry, inducing the need for policies that would increase the demand of recycled products such as imposing minimal recycled content targets.},

It is based on two main elements: (1) diversion of urine, feces, and water at the source as the basis for efficient resource recovery, and (2) linking different scales (family toilets and semi-centralized resource recovery). Our objective was to develop an attractive `grid-free' (i.e. functioning without piped water, sewer, and electrical grid) dry urine-diverting toilet, which provides water (through recycling on-site) for flushing, personal hygiene (anal cleansing and menstrual hygiene), and hand washing. This service, including the entire sanitation value chain, should eventually be made available as a profitable business with total user fees of 5 \textcent/p/d. The results presented in this paper are (1) a toilet design model, (2) the development of a new type of membrane bioreactor for treating flush and wash water, (3) main results of a geographic information system-based stochastic service model to link the family-scale toilet to a community-scale Resource Recovery Plant, and (4) a business model that yields maximum profit for the local community. We conclude that the approach is feasible, but challenging from a technical as well as an organizational point of view.},

  abstract = {[Socio-technical transition theory is increasingly being used in research and practice to explain and guide transitions toward sustainability. Although recognizing the coevolution of technology and society, multi-scalar influences, and complex social processes, transition theory has thus far inadequately accounted for the role of power and in shaping transitions. This study uses the example of the transition-in-progress toward more sustainable e-waste practices in South Africa as one illustration of how power shapes the successes, failures, and direction of transitions. I look specifically at three transition arenas that are competing for legitimacy to guide the South African e-waste transition and show how their history, membership, and rules of participation shape the different pathways promoted by these organizations. In the South African case, vested interests and constraints on participation resulted in the splintering of original transition arena. While socio-technical transition theory suggests the importance of different competing niche experiments, in this case, different pathways are being promoted by different coalitions of actors through different arenas. The presence of multiple arenas and pathways has divided resources, created confusion, and arguably delayed the transition. Further, the scope for participation in these organizations differs, and this has implications for the redistribution of power. I suggest the need to more carefully consider the role of power, trust, and legitimacy within socio-technical transition theory and specifically within the transition arena. Importantly, analyzing the transition arena as a site of contestation over the distribution of costs and benefits of the particular pathway will enhance socio-technical transition theory's explanatory power regarding how and why particular outcomes emerge.]}

Yet, despite the importance of solid waste management in the urban environment, the ways in which many municipalities across the world handle the issue show that there is much room for improvement. The ever-growing amounts of solid waste being produced across the world, especially in developing countries, are mostly due to problems such as lack of policies and financing, as well as the non-availability of irregular services. They compel many local authorities to simply dispose waste, instead of managing it. But even though much is known about individual approaches and methods to manage municipal waste, there is a lack of research which specifically looks at integrated urban waste management. The paper addresses this need by reviewing the state of the art on municipal solid waste management in a sample of developing countries and rapidly growing regions. The paper has identified the fact that the wide range of approaches and available technologies in the field of urban waste management are not being fully used. Also, there is a general lack of governance in this field, which makes it difficult to use waste management systems for improved urban ecological infrastructure. The paper, which pays special attention to experiences from Latin America (with a special focus on Brazil), Asian countries as well as the European Union new Member States (the Baltic States), documents and presents some of their experiences, which may be useful to other developing countries and rapidly growing regions.},

The negative impacts and effects of plastic waste are now widely known and have been subject of much recent media coverage, both in Europe and on a global level. Faced with increasing amounts of plastic waste, the European Union as a whole and many European governments in particular, are currently revising the policy options available to cope with the problem. One of the tools which may be deployed with a view to reducing the pressures posed by plastic waste, is the Extended Producer Responsibility principle. It is considered to be one of the major waste management policy instruments that support the implementation of the European waste hierarchy. Its application may assist in fostering the collection and recycling of waste streams that contain plastic. This paper presents an overview of the problems posed by plastic waste, and outlines their environmental dimensions. It discusses the role of the Extended Producer Responsibility principle and provides some recommendations that may be useful in enhancing extended producer responsibility.},

Biomass burning, resuspended dust, combustion, iron and steel industry, sea salt, secondary aerosol, and vehicle exhaust were identified at the DSL site by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF).

  abstract = {Highway pavement construction with recycled solid waste materials had become a sustainable topic of great concern recently, due to the potential environmental and economic benefits behind. This review focused on the emerging Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) studies concerning the recycling of solid waste in highway pavement. Firstly, based on the existing studies, the application of most recycled solid waste materials (e.g. recycled asphalt pavement, steel slag and coal fly ash) in highway pavement performed satisfactorily from the environmental and economic perspectives, concretely manifested in the reduction of energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, costs and other indicators. However, several factors, such as lengthened transport distance of recycled waste solid materials and potential leaching of heavy metals, might hinder the recycling. Moreover, it was necessary to pay more attention to pavement use phase, allocation procedure and transport distance of recycled solid waste materials, which had significant impacts on LCA result. In terms of existing LCCAs, the importance of analysis period and discount rate was highlighted and the most practical economic indicator was Net Present Value (NPV). For future study, allocation was still an important issue for future LCA studies and further sensitivity analyses could focus on the selection of transport modes (in LCA), analysis periods and discount rates (in LCCA). Meanwhile, future research should emphasis on the recycling of solid waste in pavement maintenance and rehabilitation projects rather than new construction. A multi-criteria assessment integrated LCA and LCCA as well as other considerations (e.g. an advanced risk assessment) was recommended to determine the most sustainable recycling scenarios.},

  abstract = {With increasing numbers of motor vehicles, vehicle exhaust gas has become one of the most important sources of urban air pollutants. After being emitted from the motor vehicle, exhaust gas spreads through the air along the road and is gradually deposited in the surrounding area, having an adverse impact on pedestrians and residents. At present, most research on vehicle exhaust directly measures the total emissions from the exhaust pipe or monitors the time variation of air pollutants at the roadside by setting roadside monitoring stations. The spatial resolution of these two methods is very low, however, and it is impossible to describe accurately the diffusion patterns of exhaust gas in the atmosphere after discharge. Some scholars have conducted research on the quality of roadside air by hand-held portable devices, but these are limited by the speed of travel, and the spatial and temporal resolution of the acquired data is also very low. By using multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and portable equipment, this study demonstrates an atmospheric environment monitoring system based on multi-rotor UAV by designing corresponding hardware circuits and software programs. With flexible requirements for takeoff or landing sites and high maneuverability of multi-rotor UAVs, the system increases the capability for high resolution spatial and temporal monitoring of the diffusion of traffic-emitted pollutants. The system can conduct fixed-point measurement by hovering, and can also measure air pollutants in complex urban terrain, providing an innovation in the study of vehicle exhaust gas diffusion.},

  abstract = {Most households in Uganda depend on traditional use of wood fuels associated with huge environmental and health issues. Even with the future development of a sustainable national grid, small-scale solutions like efficient biomass stoves, biochar, and biogas installations will remain important. Despite the apparent benefits from clean cooking resulting from ``dissemination'' programs since the 1980's, many developing country households have been slow to adopt them. Hence, questions arise concerning commercially viable business development. This study takes a qualitative approach and actors-based perspective from the major players at the supply-side of the clean cooking on biomass market sector. A field research in Kampala (Uganda) explored the success factors according to local private actors' perceptions. The confrontation between these perceptions and a literature-based success-factor framework revealed original insights in terms of enabling conditions to strengthen the supply-side, related to the demand-side and the clean cooking market. First, becoming a `clean cooking champion' is still highly dependent on the role of supportive and intervening development programs, especially in terms of financing, capacity-building, and awareness-raising. Second, up to now, carbon finance is an additional incentive rather than a determining factor for business activities in the clean cooking sector. Third, while some policies and targets exist, private sector respondents lament the lack of a level playing field and the competition of the informal cooking sector. Thus, this research provides an empirical basis for a possible approach to leverage private sector experience and expertise to improve access to clean cooking on biomass in Uganda.},

Mobile sampling campaigns deploying low-cost ({$<$} \$300) air quality sensors could potentially offer an inexpensive and practical approach to measure and model air pollution concentration levels. In this study, we developed LUR models for street-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration levels in Seoul, South Korea. 169 h of data were collected from an approximately three week long campaign across five routes by ten volunteers sharing seven AirBeams, a low-cost (\$250 per unit), smartphone-based particle counter, while geospatial data were extracted from OpenStreetMap, an open-source and crowd-generated geographical dataset. We applied and compared three statistical approaches in constructing the LUR models \textendash{} linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), and stacked ensemble (SE) combining multiple machine learning algorithms \textendash which resulted in cross-validation R2 values of 0.63, 0.73, and 0.80, respectively, and identification of several pollution `hotspots.' The high R2 values suggest that study designs employing mobile sampling in conjunction with multiple low-cost air quality monitors could be applied to characterize urban street-level air quality with high spatial resolution, and that machine learning models could further improve model performance. Given this study design's cost-effectiveness and ease of implementation, similar approaches may be especially suitable for citizen science and community-based endeavors, or in regions bereft of air quality data and preexisting air monitoring networks, such as developing countries.},

The AAE of black carbon (BC) particles is widely accepted to be 1.0, although observational estimates give quite a wide range of 0.6\textendash 1.3. With considerable uncertainties related to observations, a numerical study is a powerful method, if not the only one, to provide a better and more accurate understanding on BC AAE. This study calculates BC AAE using realistic particle geometries based on fractal aggregate and an accurate numerical optical model (namely the multiple-sphere T-matrix method), and considers bulk properties of an ensemble of BC particles following lognormal size distributions. At odds with the expectations, BC AAE is not 1.0, even when BC is assumed to have small sizes and a wavelength-independent refractive index. With a wavelength-independent refractive index, the AAE of fresh BC is approximately 1.05 and relatively insensitive to particle size. For BC with geometric mean diameters larger than 0.12\,\textmu m, BC AAE becomes smaller when BC particles are aged (compact structures or coated by other non-absorptive materials). For coated BC, we prescribe the coating fraction variation based on a laboratory study, where smaller BC cores are shown to develop larger coating fractions than those of bigger BC cores. For both compact and coated BC, the AAE is highly sensitive to particle size distribution, ranging from approximately 0.8 to even over 1.4 with wavelength-independent refractive index. When the refractive index is allowed to vary with wavelength, a feature with observational backing, the BC AAE may show an even wider range. For different BC morphologies, we derive simple empirical equations on BC AAE based on our numerical results, which can serve as a guide for the response of BC AAE to BC size and refractive index. Due to its complex influences, the effects of BC geometry is better to be discussed at certain BC properties, i.e., known size and refractive index.},

Specific source tracers suggested that coal combustion and biomass burning dominated in different pollution episodes. Ratios of BC/PM2.5 and BC/CO as well as source tracers provided further supportive evidences for the source apportionment results.

Moreover, biomass combustion can be an important source of air pollution in rural areas, comparable to vehicle and industrial emissions in urban planning. And their air pollutants are mainly affected by local sources. For this reason, a survey on rural air pollution was carried out in this study. Therefore, portable, battery-powered monitoring devices were used to measure particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PM1, particle number concentration, and black carbon) in order to study air quality in rural communities. The focus of the investigations was to explore the application of mobile monitoring equipment in small-scale environments, compare the differences in rural air pollutants between two neighboring villages in two countries, and the identification of pollution hotspots. The measurements were carried out in November 2018 in two villages on the German-Czech border. Over a period of four days, 21 mobile measurements along fixed routes were carried out simultaneously at both locations. The analysis of the data revealed significant differences in PN and PM concentrations in rural air pollutants between the two countries. The spatial and temporal distribution of air pollution hotspots in the Czech village was higher than that in the German village. The relationships between the measurement parameters were weak but highly significant and the meteorological parameters can effect air pollution. Overall, the results of this study show that mobile measurements are suitable for effectively recording and distinguishing spatial and temporal characteristics of air quality.},

Parameters evaluated included the inter-variability between individual monitors, the accuracy of monitors in comparison with the reference instruments, the effect of temperature and RH on the performance of the monitors, the responses of the PM2.5 sensors to different types of aerosols, and the long-term stability of the PM2.5 and CO sensors. The monitors showed high inter-correlations (r {$>$} 0.91) for both PM2.5 and CO measurements. The monitor performance varied with location, with moderate to good correlations with reference instruments for PM2.5 (0.44 {$<$} R2 {$<$} 0.91) and CO (0.37 {$<$} R2 {$<$} 0.90). The monitors performed well at relative humidity {$<$} 75\% and high temperature conditions; however, two monitors in Beijing failed at low temperatures, probably due to electronic board failure. The PM2.5 sensor was less sensitive to marine aerosols and fresh vehicle emissions than to mixed urban background emissions, aged traffic emissions and industrial emissions. The long-term stability of the PM2.5 and CO sensors was good, while CO relative errors were affected by both high and low temperatures. Overall, the KOALA monitors performed well in the environments in which they were operated and provided a valuable contribution to long-term air quality monitoring within the elucidated limitations.},

Due to it being relatively new on the market, the field lacks a refined assessment of the instrument's performance under various settings and data post-processing approaches. This study assessed the mobile real-time performance of the MA200 to determine a suitable noise reduction algorithm in an urban area, Augsburg, Germany. Noise reduction and negative value mitigation were explored via different data post-processing methods (i.e., local polynomial regression (LPR), optimized noise reduction averaging (ONA), and centred moving average (CMA)) under common sampling interval times (i.e., 5, 10, and 30 s). After noise reduction, the treated data were evaluated and compared by (1) the amount of useful information attributed to retention of microenvironmental characteristics, (2) the relative number of negative values remaining, (3) the reduction and retention of peak samples, and (4) the amount of useful signal retained after correction for local background conditions. Our results identify CMA as a useful tool for isolating the central trends of raw black carbon concentration data in real time while reducing nonsensical negative values and the occurrence and magnitudes of peak samples that affect visual assessment of the data without substantially affecting bias. Correction for local background concentrations improved the CMA treatment by bringing nuanced microenvironmental changes into view. This analysis employs a number of different post-processing methods for black carbon data, providing comparative insights for researchers looking for black carbon data smoothing approaches, specifically in a mobile monitoring framework and data collected using the microAeth\textsuperscript{\textregistered} series of Aethalometer.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This article explores the `shrinking state', the potential erosion of the state from its customary intervention in regulating economic growth and promoting redistribution and the overall weakening of the state as an institution in local/regional affairs. State retreat may be seen in the withdrawal of finance, services and staff as well as the failure to increase these resources to match growing needs, both of which are referred to as `retrenchment' or, in the European case, `austerity'. The erosion of the state as an institution is visible in underfunded social programmes, a smaller public sector, weakened regulatory structures, foregone infrastructure projects, public assets sales and continued privatization. This article argues that the `shrinking state' both produces and is a product of a restructured social contract between government and citizens and the private sector that has transformed regions and localities. Although we have not seen wholesale state decline, there have been gradations of state change, especially in qualitative markers such as shifts in state functions, scales of activity, constituencies served and private sector involvement in governmental affairs. These changes, in turn, have led to shifts in state capacity and policy orientation that leave populations bereft of needed public services, increased inequality across geographic areas and sociodemographic groups, and political effects such as the growth of right-wing populism.}

  abstract = {Providing good solid waste management (SWM) services while also ensuring financial sustainability of the system continues to be a major challenge in cities of developing countries. Bahir Dar in northwestern Ethiopia outsourced municipal waste services to a private waste company in 2008. While this institutional change has led to substantial improvement in the cleanliness of the city, its financial sustainability remains unclear. Is the private company able to generate sufficient revenues from their activities to offset the costs and generate some profit? This paper presents a cost-revenue analysis, based on data from July 2009 to June 2011. The analysis reveals that overall costs in Bahir Dar's SWM system increased significantly during this period, mainly due to rising costs related to waste transportation. On the other hand, there is only one major revenue stream in place: the waste collection fee from households, commercial enterprises and institutions. As the efficiency of fee collection from households is only around 50\%, the total amount of revenues are not sufficient to cover the running costs. This results in a substantial yearly deficit. The results of the research therefore show that a more detailed cost structure and cost-revenue analysis of this waste management service is important with appropriate measures, either by the privates sector itself or with the support of the local authorities, in order to enhance cost efficiency and balance the cost-revenues towards cost recovery. Delays in mitigating the evident financial deficit could else endanger the public-private partnership (PPP) and lead to failure of this setup in the medium to long term, thus also endangering the now existing improved and currently reliable service. We present four options on how financial sustainability of the SWM system in Bahir Dar might be enhanced: (i) improved fee collection efficiency by linking the fees of solid waste collection to water supply; (ii) increasing the value chain by sales of organic waste recycling products; (iii) diversifying revenue streams and financing mechanisms (polluter-pays-, cross-subsidy- and business-principles); and (iv) cost reduction and improved cost-effectiveness. We argue that in a PPP setup such as in Bahir Dar, a strong alliance between the municipality and private enterprise is important so that appropriate solutions for improved financial sustainability of a SWM system can be sought and implemented.},

This article presents a comprehensive overview of 13 biowaste treatment technologies, grouped into four categories: (1) direct use (direct land application, direct animal feed, direct combustion), (2) biological treatment (composting, vermicomposting, black soldier fly treatment, anaerobic digestion, fermentation), (3) physico-chemical treatment (transesterification, densification), and (4) thermo-chemical treatment (pyrolysis, liquefaction, gasification). Based on a literature review and expert consultation, the main feedstock requirements, process conditions and treatment products are summarized, and the challenges and trends, particularly regarding the applicability of each technology in the urban low- and middle-income context, are critically discussed. An analysis of the scientific articles published from 2005 to 2015 reveals substantial differences in the amount and type of research published for each technology, a fact that can partly be explained with the development stage of the technologies. Overall, publications from case studies and field research seem disproportionately underrepresented for all technologies. One may argue that this reflects the main task of researchers\textemdash to conduct fundamental research for enhanced process understanding\textemdash but it may also be a result of the traditional embedding of the waste sector in the discipline of engineering science, where socio-economic and management aspects are seldom object of the research. More unbiased, well-structured and reproducible evidence from case studies at scale could foster the knowledge transfer to practitioners and enhance the exchange between academia, policy and practice.},

  abstract = {The Circular Economy (CE) movement is inspiring new governmental policies along with company strategies. This led to the emergence of a plethora of indicators to quantify the ``circularity'' of individual companies or products. Approaches behind these indicators builds mainly on two implicit assumptions. The first is that closing material loops at product level leads to improvements in material efficiency for the economy as a whole. The second assumption is that maximizing material circularity contributes to mitigate environmental impacts. We test these two assumptions at different scales with a case study on the circularity of PET in the USA market. The Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) reveals that closing the material loops at the product level increases material circularity in one brand and in the USA plastic bottle market but not in the USA PET market as a whole. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results reveal that increasing closed loop recycling of PET bottles is environmentally beneficial from product-level assessment scope. When expanding the scope to the whole PET market, recycling PET into film, fiber and sheet industrial sectors results being more material efficient and environmental preferable, unless the postconsumer reclamation rate is significantly improved. Thus, we demonstrate that adopting a systemic approach for CE assessment is essential ; instead of looking at one particular product and seeking the best circular case with respect to a specific material content, we suggest to looking at the whole set of products served by the specific material, and to seek the best material market-wide circular case.},

Closed-loop recycling happens to compete with other applications more beneficial from an environmental point of view, even if PET used in these applications cannot be further recycled. Sensitivity analysis reveal that efforts should rather concentrate on increasing the post-consumer bottle collection rate and improving the efficiency of low-quality recycling.
\par
The argument that improving material circularity of one product brand is beneficial for the average product market is not necessarily true. This case study demonstrates that material circular strategies at the product level do not necessarily give significant benefits when there is an important ``sink'' of the material (final use without recycling options) that is much greater than the recovered quantities, or the recycling process itself is material/energy/emission intensive compared to the supply of virgin material. Combining material circularity assessment and LCA is essential to identify trade-offs between material circularity and environmental performance.},

In 1994, the European Commission implemented the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/EC, responding to growing concerns regarding the environmental impact of packaging and safe waste management. This study analyses how Germany, Spain, France, Italy, and Poland\textemdash the five most populous countries in the EU~(European Union)\textemdash manage their plastic packaging waste, and evaluates their established Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, which are~mandatory for all EU Member States by the end of 2024. This research shows that EPR schemes improve the financial and operational viability of plastic waste management in the scope countries, resulting in higher collection and recycling rates. Take-back requirements can incentivise producers to put less plastic packaging on the market, and advanced disposal fees can encourage eco-design. The Producer Responsibility Organisation plays a crucial role in both producer and consumer awareness, and in ensuring that plastic waste is safely managed. However, the local recycling infrastructure of 6.5 Mt in 2018 is a major barrier to reaching 50\% recycling of plastic packaging in the EU by 2025. The European recycling capacity only covered about 23\% of the cumulative post-consumer plastic waste generation, delaying the transition to the EU circular plastic economy. The recycling capacity has increased by 3 Mt between 2018 and 2020 and needs to continue its rapid expansion to become autonomous in reaching the recycling targets.},

Respondents were told that two doses of the vaccine would be required 2 weeks apart, and that the cholera vaccine would offer excellent protection against infection for the first year following vaccination, and some protection during the second and third year after a person is vaccinated. This research was carried out in order to learn more about private demand for vaccines in a cholera-endemic area. We asked two types of valuation questions: (1) a discrete-price offer for a vaccine that could be purchased for household members and (2) a payment card designed to assess uncertainty in the respondent's demand for a vaccine for self-protection. We estimate average household willingness to pay (WTP) for cholera vaccines in Beira to be 2005 US\$ 8.45. This estimate of household WTP represents the perceived private economic benefits to a household \textendash{} six persons on average \textendash{} of giving all members free cholera vaccines.},

The first part discusses the conceptual underpinnings of participatory approaches. The paper then analyses stakeholder perceptions about the Household-centred Environmental Sanitation (HCES) approach, a participatory planning approach recently validated in two countries: Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) and Nepal. Post intervention surveys were conducted with experts and key informants in both countries to assess satisfaction regarding degree of participation, effectiveness of planning outcomes and process efficiency of the participatory planning process. It specifically looks at the variability in people's perceptions about the costs and benefits of community participation. Empirical findings show that experts and participants show high satisfaction rates regarding involvement in decision making. The earlier and stronger residents were involved in the process, the higher the satisfaction rate. In a second part, the main findings of expert interviews are contrasted with the perceptions of the community at large which participated in the participatory planning process. A better understanding of community participation in urban settings is needed regarding skills, motivation, time, and defining the right levels of participation.},

  abstract = {Purpose Rapid economic growth and urbanization in India have increased demand for municipal services. In response, privatization has emerged as a policy solution to a growing deficit in urban infrastructure and service provision. But, privatization assumes prior state ownership of those services. Certain waste management services, specifically doorstep waste collection, have never been truly public in the sense that private informal actors have historically provided them. The purpose of this paper is to examine the tensions and contradictions between two related policy imperatives \textendash{} universal service provision and privatization \textendash{} that appear to be guiding the municipalization of solid waste collection services in urban India. Design/methodology/approach Research for this paper relies on detailed analysis of key government documents (reports of various committees, regulations and laws) that have been important in defining municipal responsibilities for waste management in India from 1990 to 2016. In addition, where appropriate, research materials from the author's doctoral dissertation fieldwork in Delhi from October 2012 to December 2013 have also been used. Findings An analysis of key policy documents revealed that the government's efforts to document deficits in service provision ignored, and thus rendered invisible, the work of the informal sector. While a consensus on the need for universal waste collection service had emerged as early as the late 1990s, it was not until 2016 that municipal responsibility for service provision was codified into law. The rules issued in 2016 municipalized this responsibility while simultaneously opening up spaces for the inclusion of the informal sector in waste collection service provision. Originality/value This paper fills a gap in the existing literature on how policy interventions have brought the space of the doorstep into the ambit of the state such that it allows for the opening up of those spaces for the entry of private capital. Under the guise of universal service provision, the shift to municipalization and outsourcing to private corporations is not in fact privatization \textendash{} service provision is already private \textendash{} but involves the dispossession of informal workers and the transfer of their resource to the formal, corporate sector.}

Further, the place of informal workers in the history of waste management policy and programs is more complicated than that provided by linear accounts of a transition from informal to formal in the existing scholarship. In contrast to existing explanations of these shifts, this paper draws attention to the rise of efficiency as a core municipal concern that explains the shifting relationship arrangements between the state, the informal private sector, and the formal private sector in waste collection markets. To address their concerns with cost of service delivery, Indian policy-makers justified privatization by indirectly drawing upon the influential work of E.S. Savas, the American economist credited with empirically substantiating the theory of efficiency gains from privatization in waste collection markets. Yet, informal systems are in practice not only more efficient than formal ones, they also conform well to Savas? policy prescriptions for structuring waste collection markets. Efficiency could thus serve as a basis for securing informal workers? claims as legitimate market participants.},

However, less attention has been paid to how such codes are (re)produced and (re)directed by informal workers and their organisations in everyday practice. Drawing upon a multisided ethnography in Kampala and Delhi, this paper explores the ways in which market vendors and waste collectors have responded to the proliferation of three aesthetic technologies: the identity card, the uniform, and the code of conduct. We show that workers have appropriated these technologies in creative ways in order to defend their livelihoods against the threat of displacement. However, this act of appropriation has come at the cost of the exclusion of the more vulnerable workers, who now find their activities policed not only by the state but also by a range of non-state organisations. These findings contribute to debates on labour organisation and world-class city making by demonstrating the ways in which aesthetic rationalities emerge through an encounter with the tactics of everyday life.},

A central element of industrial ecology is the concept of closing the loop in material use (cycling) by directing used material and products (wastes) back to production processes. This article examines the issue of geographic scale and loop closing for heterogeneous wastes through an analysis of the location and materials flows of a set of recycling, remanufacturing, recycling manufacturing, and waste treatment (RRWT) firms in Texas. The results suggest that there is no preferable scale at which loop closing should be organized. RRWT firms are ubiquitous and operate successfully throughout the settlement hierarchy. The cycling boundaries of RRWT firms are dependent primarily upon how and where their products are redirected to production processes rather than the firm's location in the settlement hierarchy. In other words, loop closing is dominated by the spatial economic logic of the transactions of the firm involved. These results suggest that we cannot assign loop closing to any particular spatial scale a priori nor can we conceive of closing the loop via RRWT firms in terms of monolithic networks bounded in space or place with internal material flows.},

FRA 2015 builds on a series of global assessments that began in 1948 and covers change in forest area and type, volume, biomass and carbon stocking, measures of sustainable forest management, biodiversity and conservation, soil and water protective functions, wood production and a number of socio-economic variables. It covers 234 countries and territories with an emphasis on forest resource change over a twenty-five year period (1990\textendash 2015) and also looks forward to anticipated forest change \textendash{} both as government targets for forest area and projected change (to 2030) to global production and conservation forest area (to the year 2050). This paper describes important contributions of global forest resource estimates to forest management, the methods used in the collection and analysis of FRA 2015 data and provides links to additional information resources. It discusses some of the limitations of this global dataset, some of the steps taken to improve quality and the characteristics that make this type of global data most useful. While forest area change dominates public use of the FRA, the state of the forest resource and management is critical to understanding the ecological and social values of the forest and forestry. Country level reporting not only provides insights that are only possible through national reporting but also provides greater national-level understanding and discussion of forest resource change. The papers that follow in this Special Issue provide analyses of FRA 2015 data covering a wide range of topics related to sustainable forest management and forest change.},

  abstract = {Landfill mining, a process of extracting and processing waste from stored deposits, has been touted within waste management discourses as circular economy strategy for sustainable resource recovery and reuse. However, within the Global South, where many contexts lack engineered landfilles, or even consolidated dumpsites, what relevance does the concept hold? The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of a 'mining' strategy for recovering a reusing stockpiled waste glass in Chembe, Malawi within burnt clay bricks and hardened concrete, the two most common building materials within the village. Findings suggest that a proposed 'village mining' strategy, that mines stored stocks of waste glass throughout the village for use in the local consturctoin industry, could benefit multiple stakeholders, with crushed waste glass content of up to 10\% demonstrating performancing enhancing qualities within burnt clay bricks in certain building applications. Developing this process could lead to income generation for the Chembe village brick makers and embracing this new concept could trigger consistent and intensive waste glass mining at local village dumpsites.},

  abstract = {Government is expected by its citizens to deliver services with the highest degree of quality and  of suitable standards. This results in citizens' satisfaction and positive perceptions of their  government. Any failure of government to meet citizens' expectations results in dissatisfaction  and protests. In line with this assertion, the study primarily aimed at analysing the perceptions of  the Johanna/Boxwood Road Informal Settlement's dwellers, in relation to the provision of water  services by the eThekwini Municipality. It also sought to propose policy recommendations at a  strategic level in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to advance quality waterservice  delivery beyond 2015. The study was grounded on the Expectation-Perception and Core-  Value theories. The two theories centre their perspectives on the customer's view and on the  ethos of customer service. These aspects accentuate the essence of organisations, including  government, measuring the perceptions and expectations of customers. Their constructs are  premised on reliability, assurance, tangibility, empathy, and responsiveness when services are  delivered. One hundred units of analysis were drawn as the sample from the Johanna/Boxwood  Road Informal Settlement, using a random sampling technique for the quantitative research  method. Fifteen senior officials were interviewed from eThekwini Municipality's Water and  Sanitation Unit, deploying the qualitative research method. The data collected was analysed  using SPSS Version 23 for the quantitative research method, and Nvivo Version 10 for the  qualitative research method. A huge percentage of the Johanna/Boxwood Road Informal  Settlement dwellers surveyed believed that the quality of water delivered by eThekwini  Municipality was high, and the delivery of water was reliable. They further asserted that the  municipality was empathetic when delivering water services for them, expressing confidence in  it. However, the results also stressed the importance of developing a policy that would be  responsive to the needs of the citizens, and which would positively affect the lives of the  common people. The findings further underscored the essence of enhancing communication  between the municipality and the community when services such as water were delivered. The  monitoring and evaluation tools were also identified by the study as being critical to measuring  the progress when delivering services, particularly water.  The major recommendations of the study are that: 1) eThekwini Municipality should improve  communication with the community, 2) eThekwini Municipality should develop response strategies on how to efficiently deliver water services to areas, such as Johanna/Boxwood Road  Informal Settlement, 3) more work needs to be done in order to understand how the water is  collected and stored at household level, 4) more relationship building with the community should  be undertaken by eThekwini Municipality, and 5) eThekwini Municipality should evaluate uts  incentive programme at lower levels in order to encourage more productivity. Collectively, the  recommendations of the study suggest the transformation of developmental local government,  such as eThekwini Municipality in improving service delivery and good governance. This serves  to fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) espoused by the United Nations, 2015, in  terms of Goal 6 which places emphasis on ensuring availability and sustainable management of  water and sanitation to all by 2030. The model proposed in the last chapter of the dissertation  should therefore be adopted to enhance water delivery and management at local government  level.},

  abstract = {Low-cost sensors for the measurement of fine particulate matter mass (PM2.5) enable dense networks to increase the spatial resolution of air quality monitoring. However, these sensors are affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity and their effects on ambient aerosol, which must be accounted for to improve the in-field accuracy of these sensors. We conducted long-term tests of two low-cost PM2.5 sensors: Met-One NPM and PurpleAir PA-II units. We found a high level of self-consistency within each sensor type after testing 25 NPM and 9 PurpleAir units. We developed two types of corrections for the lowcost sensor measurements to better match regulatory-grade data. The first correction accounts for aerosol hygroscopic growth using particle composition and corrects for particle mass below the optical sensor size cut-point by collocation with reference Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAM). A second, fully-empirical correction uses linear or quadratic functions of environmental variables based on the same collocation dataset. The two models yielded comparable improvements over raw measurements. Sensor performance was assessed for two use cases: improving community awareness of air quality with short-term semi-quantitative comparisons of sites and providing long-term reasonably quantitative information for health impact studies. For the short-term case, both sensors provided reasonably accurate concentration information (mean absolute error of \$4 mg/m3) in near-real time. For the long-term case, tested using year-long collocations at one urban background and one nearsource site, error in the annual average was reduced below 1 mg/m3. Hence, these sensors can supplement sparse networks of regulatory-grade instruments, perform high-density neighborhood-scale monitoring, and be used to better understand spatial patterns and temporal air quality trends across urban areas.},

In Malawi, hand-tied sachets of water are common but not regulated, and the quality of the water and hygienic practices during packaging are unclear. We analyzed microbial concentrations in the source water (origin), internal water (packaged) and on the external surface (plastic bag) of sachets from 76 vendors operating in the busy Mwanza crossing into Malawi from Mozambique. The results indicated that the majority (75\%) of the water sources met the WHO guidelines ({$<$}1 CFU/100 mL) for potable water, while only 38\% of the water inside packages met this guideline, indicating a sharp increase in contamination due to packaging and handling practices. The external surface was highly contaminated and is the point of contact between the consumer's mouth and the liquid within; furthermore, external contamination was a strong and significant predictor of internal contamination. We advise against strict enforcement that would limit access to this important drinking water source, but recommend hygiene education for vendors that focuses on filling and storage, refrigeration and especially ensuring sanitary coolers from which the bags are sold in order to limit re-contamination during handling.},

The study assess levels and variations of carbon monoxide (CO),~nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in Blantyre, Malawi using a stationary environmental~monitoring station (EMS). Results show that CO level (2.47 {$\pm$} 1.23 mg m-3) were below the Malawian limit~value (10.31 mg m-3). Although, NO2 (4.02 {$\pm$} 2.47 mg m-3) and SO2 (8.58 {$\pm$} 2.88 mg m-3) were significantly~higher than allowable Malawian Standards (0.52 and 0.23 mg m-3, respectively). Discernible variations in~hourly, diurnal, monthly and seasonal CO, SO2 and NO2 were apparent. Independent t-test confirmed~that day time values were higher than those at night (p {$<$} 0.05). Thus, variations in local weather affect~the disparity in hourly and diurnal values. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed significant variations~in monthly observations. Moreover, independent t-test showed that wet season CO (2.32 mg m-3), SO2~(5.10 mg m-3) and NO2 (9.41 mg m-3) levels were higher than dry season values (CO = 2.32 mg m-3; SO2 =~3.42 mg m-3; NO2 = 8.13 mg m-3). A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) divided the 10 months into three~groups based on distribution of CO, SO2 and NO2, air temperature, wind speed and wind direction.~Furthermore, factor analysis (FA) showed that air temperature had significant contribution to variations~in mean values of CO, SO2 and NO2 for the entire study period. The study shows a need for constant~urban air quality monitoring in Blantyre and all urban areas in Malawi. It is recommended that the~experimental site widen the scope of the study by utilizing the flexibility of the EMS.~Key words: Air pollutants, principal component analysis, developing countries, environmental monitoringstation, Kaiser normalization.},

In high-density low-income urban areas, there is only a limited choice for safely-managed sanitation: (i) simplified/condominial sewerage (which becomes cheaper than on-site sanitation systems at the relatively low population densities of 160\textendash 200 people per ha), (ii) low-cost combined sewerage (if it is cheaper than separate simplified sewerage and stormwater drainage), (iii) community-managed sanitation blocks, and (iv) container-based sanitation (the last two of which are suitable, especially in slums, when neither simplified sewerage nor low-cost combined sewerage is affordable or technically feasible). These four sustainable sanitation options are as scalable in developing countries as conventional sewerage has been in industrialized countries.},

Despite their prevalence, these workers have received scant scholarly attention. Addressing this gap, this article studies Employment Goal Planners (EGPs) employed at private for-profit providers of activation services in Israel. Drawing on extensive ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews, it argues that far from detached ?mercenaries?, private state workers are committed actors who advance a distinct vision of public service delivery suited to the neoliberal state. These workers navigate their liminal position along an ever-shifting state/market divide by intertwining contemporary market tropes onto outdated schemas of state work. While the literature commonly views the market as an imposition on public service workers, this study finds that the market can also serve as a resource for inspiring alternative public service ethics and work models.},

  abstract = {Background: Facilitating access to health data for public health and research purposes is an important element in the health policy agenda of many countries. Improvements in this sense can only be achieved with the development of an appropriate data infrastructure and the implementations of policies that also respect societal preferences. Switzerland is a revealing example of a country that has been struggling to achieve this aim. The objective of the study is to reflect on stakeholders' recommendations on how to improve the health data framework of this country.Methods: We analysed the recommendations collected as part of a qualitative study including 48 expert stakeholders from Switzerland that have been working principally with health databases. Recommendations were divided in themes and subthemes according to applied thematic analysis.Results: Stakeholders recommended several potential improvements of the health data framework in Switzerland. At the general level of mind-set and attitude, they suggested to foster the development of an explicit health data strategy, better communication and the respect of societal preferences. In terms of infrastructure, there were calls for the creation of a national data center, the improvement of IT solutions and the use of a Unique Identifier for patient data. Lastly, they recommended harmonising procedures for data access and to clarify data protection and consent rules.Conclusion: Recommendations show several potential improvements of the health data framework, but they have to be reconciled with existing policies, infrastructures and ethico-legal limitations. Achieving a gradual implementation of the recommended solutions is the preferable way forward for Switzerland and a lesson for other countries that are also seeking to improve health data access for public health and research purposes.},

  abstract = {Nature conservation relies largely on peoples' rule adherence. Nevertheless, non-compliance with regulations threatens in situ conservation in nearly every protected area (PA) and remains an intractable issue. We reviewed the available published scholarly literature on non-compliant biological resource-use in terrestrial protected areas (TPAs) of sub-Saharan Africa. The focus is on two objectives, firstly, to disentangle the complex drivers behind the various types of deviant behaviour observed in these PAs, and secondly, to assess the strategies deployed on the ground to deter such illegalities. Using 72 selected journal articles published between 2001 and 2021, we recorded nine types of deviant behaviour or illegal resource extraction that were reported. Poaching activity overshadowed all other criminal behaviours. Drivers varied according to the type of crime perpetrated or resources targeted. Poverty was the most cited driver of non-compliance, particularly for illegal bushmeat hunting. PA resentment prompted by destructive errant wildlife was almost as strong a motivation as material poverty. To deter offenders from committing a crime, a combination of interventions, i.e., law enforcement and a spectrum of non-enforcement approaches, such as Reformed Poachers Associations, long-term research sites and resource-access agreements, were deployed. Our synthesis demonstrates that the growing sub-Saharan African literature on non-compliant biological resource-use in TPAs is dominated by bushmeat poaching drivers. Other motives for PA offences by border villagers are scarcely dealt with in the peer-reviewed literature. Future studies of wildlife crime need to address PA transgression multidimensionality, not just bushmeat poaching, to reveal further drivers of transgressive behaviour and ultimately allow for evidence-informed conservation intervention design.},

Uncollected waste is dumped indiscriminately by inhabitants into water bodies or floodplains or else burnt, thus contaminating water, land and air of the city area and beyond. Rather than searching for solutions to improve collection and disposal services, this paper presents research which focuses on the production of waste at household level, and explores how household waste segregation can preserve the value of recyclable materials, enhance their accessibility to informal workers of the recycling sector and reduce the overall waste flows. The analysis of the informal recycling industry and its stakeholders as well as waste generation and composition shows that there is still a large untapped potential. However any initiative aiming to increase source segregation and access to more recyclables needs to carefully consider all ``integrated'' aspects of the waste management system which influence and determine sustainability and success of the envisaged improvement. Practicality of segregation at the household level as well as regularity of collection or purchase of recyclables by the informal sector need to be addressed as priority.},

  abstract = {The position paper has consolidated a number of reports and studies that have been done over the years supplemented by empirical evidence through photography to highlight the current status of Malawi's trees and forests. The paper looks at the history of forest conservation in Malawi from the period before independence, early post-independence during Kamuzu Banda era, and the multi-party democracy period. All these periods have their own milestones and challenges in forest conservation and management in Malawi. The paper has also looked at forest cover trends in Malawi. In general, Malawi has lost her forest cover by over 40\% between 1972 and 1990. This figure should be much less now. More forest cover has been lost in communal areas compared to public protected areas. There are many factors that have led to forest cover loss amongst which are high population growth, opening of forests for settlements and agriculture; tobacco growing, biomass energy, brick burning, urbanization and inadequate budgetary support from government. The paper has tried to look at the policy and legal framework to justify and underscore the fact that Malawi has the necessary policy and legal instruments in place for effective forest and tree management. A number of supporting instruments such as programmes and strategies also exist. It is also found that a number of interventions have taken place by government, local communities and the private sector to address the issue of forest and tree management in Malawi. To this end, a review of some public and community forest programmes has been made. Despite the existence of a robust policy and legal framework, strategies, programmes and guidelines and many interventions done by both government, private sector and civil society, a number of issues have been identified which are impinging on sustainable forest and tree management in Malawi. Some of these issues include but are not limited to the following:- land tenure and ownership of trees and forests, policy and implementation failure, influence of politics; laisser-faire approach to forest management, professional concubinage, corruption, poor governance at local level, in-efficient administration and weak leadership; inadequate funding and its prioritization and globalization and Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPS). The paper concludes with some recommendations on the way forward and possible advocacy issues and actions for CURE and its partners to engage Government of Malawi and the people of Malawi if our forests and trees are to be sustainably managed.},

The main objective of this work is to study the relevancy of choice experiment techniques as a tool aimed at measuring economic values and assessing user preferences concerning the multi-attribute and multi-value services as supplied by cultural institutions. A set of alternative incremental changes in service attributes showing improvements in supply are designed and presented to visitors. Alternative conditional logit specifications are used for analysing stated choices over the hypothetical incremental changes in museum attributes. Willingness to pay for incremental variations concerning site attributes is positive and statistically significant for most changes. Conditional logit specifications, which incorporate heterogeneity by adding interaction socio-economic terms, are generally robust and do not violate the IIA assumption. In addition, in the present case study, non-IIA models do not outperform conditional logit models. Choice experiments confirm as being a practical and effective tool for non-market valuation, and they should be used to provide information to decision makers for justifying demand led policies.},

  abstract = {Given the rapid demographic growth, developing countries are increasingly facing difficulties in meeting the sanitation needs of their populations. Various strategies, such as on-site sanitation, have therefore been developed to improve and facilitate access of urban dwellers to effective liquid waste management mechanisms. These sanitation facilities used by about one-third of the world population are increasingly seen as the alternative towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. However, this type of sanitation generates huge quantities of faecal sludge to be extracted and treated or conveyed to appropriate disposal sites. These important tasks are carried out by private operators whose organisational and operational structures are not always well understood. Due to their important link to on-site sanitation, the profile and profitability of these companies need to be defined to keep on-site sanitation costs under control. The case study conducted in the city of Dakar, Senegal \textendash{} a typical example of a large city in developing countries \textendash{} reveals that companies involved in domestic faecal sludge emptying can evolve both within a formal and informal framework. In most cases (68\%), as these companies only own one vacuum tanker, they can hardly make a profit if their services merely offer domestic faecal sludge emptying. Investments in other market opportunities, such as cleaning of sewerage networks or industrial emptying, have allowed these companies to reach a rate of return upwards of 20\% with the use of one or several trucks. This diversification could lead to a 32\% drop in emptying fees and to a 19\% rate of return, which can be improved by optimising the emptying equipment and enhancing the organisational structure of the faecal sludge management system.},

While alternative cooking technologies exist, sustained adoption of these is piecemeal, indicating that there is insufficient knowledge of understandings of HAP within target communities. To identify potential gaps in the literature, a scoping review was conducted focused on solid fuel users' perceptions of HAP and solid fuel use in low- and middle-income countries. From the initial 14,877 search returns, 56 were included for final analysis. An international multi-disciplinary workshop was convened to develop the research question; six key domains: health; family and community life; home, space, place and roles; cooking and cultural practices, environment; and policy and practice development, were also identified using a Social Ecological Model framework. The review showed a series of disconnects across the domains which highlighted the limited research on perceptions of HAP in the literature. Reviewed studies showed that participants emphasized short-term health impacts of HAP as opposed to longer-term health benefits of interventions and prioritized household security over improved ventilation. There was also a socio-demographic gendered disconnect as although women and children generally have most exposure to HAP, their decision-making power about use of solid fuels is often limited. In the domain of policy and practice, the review identified the importance of community norms and cultural traditions (including taste). Research in this domain, and within the environment domain is however limited and merits further attention. We suggest that interventions need to be locally situated and community-led and a deeper understanding of perceptions of HAP could be obtained using participatory and innovative research methods. Bridging the disconnects and gaps identified in this review is essential if the global disease burden associated with HAP is to be reduced.},

  abstract = {After three decades of privatization, the world is witnessing dramatic reversals in the water sector. Cities around the world are `remunicipalizing' their water services by taking them back into public control, and the pace appears to be growing. But there are also forces which may slow this trend. Private water companies appear concerned about its impact on profits, austerity has forced some governments to abandon plans for remunicipalization, and legal barriers are multiplying. There are also diverse motivations for remunicipalization, putting into question its status as a coherent political trend. This paper develops a typology of different ideological forms of remunicipalization, identifying key stakeholders and the nature of their support, as well as indicating prevalent formats and regional trends. My hypothesis is that remunicipalization will continue in the medium term due to widespread dissatisfaction with privatization, but that differences within the remunicipalization movement, combined with resistance from powerful multilateral actors, may make it difficult to sustain.},

However, land acquisition has proven challenging in some rural areas. This paper uses a contingent valuation study, based on the Teagasc National Farm Survey (NFS) of Ireland, to explore farmers' willingness to participate in greenway development. The results reveal that farmers are split on the issue of greenway land acquisition: approximately half would not allow a route to run through their farm, irrespective of compensation. Farmers' main concerns in this regard are: insurance, impact on farming operations and nuisance/crime. Of the farmers willing to participate in greenway development, the mean (once-off) payment required is \texteuro 56,000 per kilometre of greenway length. These findings suggest that Irish Government agencies and local authorities must work to alleviate farmers' concerns and undertake extensive consultation to yield acceptable route options.},

The technology is at its infant stage of development and dissemination in many developing countries while China has the largest implementation record. The principal factors controlling its dissemination include: policies and institutions, financial constraint, subsidies, availability of inputs, awareness about the technology, consumers' considerations, and success stories about the technology. However, biogas technology is a multipurpose technology which assists in addressing economic, health, social and environmental problems simultaneously. Thus, development and dissemination of the technology certainly minimize energy poverty and improve peoples' status in the energy ladder. In line with this, Ethiopia has completed implementing the first phase (2009\textendash 2013) of its National Biogas Programme and has started implementing its second phase. During the first phase, it was able to disseminate 57.6\% the total 14,000 domestic biogas plants planned for the period. Though the technology was introduced about five decades ago into the country, biogas installations constructed prior to the establishment of the National Biogas Programme were having varied digester models, lacked standards and central coordination and their entire number was not more than 1000. This paper reviews the status of dissemination of household biogas technology, factors influencing the dissemination of the technology, benefits of the technology at global scales, energy resources, consumption patterns and brief account of the technology at national scale-Ethiopia.},

  abstract = {Ambient air pollution has been associated with adverse respiratory outcomes, especially among children with asthma. This study reports on associations between daily ambient air pollutant concentrations and the respiratory symptoms of schoolchildren living in Durban, South Africa. This city is Africa's busiest port and a key hub for imported crude oil and exported refined petroleum and petrochemical products, and it experiences a mixture of air pollutants that reflects emissions from industry, traffic and biomass burning. Children in four communities in the highly industrialized southern portion of the city were compared to children of similar socio-economic profiles living in the north of the city. One school was selected in each community. A total of 423 children were recruited. Symptom logs were completed every 1.5e2 h over 3-week period in each of four seasons. Ambient concentrations of NO2, NO, SO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 were measured throughout the study. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and assess lag effects (1e5 days) using single pollutant (single lags or distributed lags) models. Concentrations of SO2 and NOx were markedly higher in the south, while PM10 did not vary. Significant increase in the odds ratios of cough were identified for the various lags analyzed. The OR of symptoms was further increased among those living in the south compared to the north. In conclusion, in this analysis of over 70,000 observations, we provide further evidence that exposure to PM10, SO2, NO2 and NO is associated with significantly increased occurrence of respiratory symptoms among children. This was evident for cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, across the four pollutants and for different lags of exposure. This is the first study describing these changes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

\par
High-quality research requires a confident application of methods.
\par
R and Python have advantages because they are open source and versatile, but also because they are among the top requested languages in nonacademic professions. [[@dasilva2019vs]]
\par
Learning a programming language requires constant practice.
\par
Elements of an inverted classroom allows the lecturer to provide input but leaves space for students to use the learned skills and practice them through online learning platforms.
\par
A coherent workflows that generates reproducible research.
\par
Teaching transferable skills: Programming; Critical and analytical thinking; teamwork and presentation experiences.
\par
\section{\textbf{Course Setup}}

\par
Peer support and facilitation of communication via interactive communication platform (Slack).
\par
No prerequisites provides a heterogeneous groio.
\par
According to Krajcik and Blumenfeld (2006, 317), ``[p]roject-based learning allows students to learn by doing and applying ideas. Students engage in real-world activities.'' 
\par
The inverted/flipped classroom model is one where problem solving happens in class and information transmission teaching happens outside of class.
\par
"because learning a new programming lan- guage is a highly independent endeavor that often requires much self-effort to find a workable solution"
\par
\subsection{Define Project Groups at the Beginning }

\subsection{Mimic a Typical Workflows}

\par
Following through single steps to replicate figures of an important article and dividing the class into five thematic blocks: (1) Introduction; (2) data wrangling and merging; (3) data visualization; (4) hackathon; (5) mini-conference.
\par
Assgined a first introductory course in R for student to be required before the first course session. This reduces heterogeneity. Allows students to experience in R in their own time.
\par
Replicate a scienctific paper
\par
In-class sessions divided into show and tell and group work to apply previously learning skills (hands-on)
\par
Short practical sections to enable students to follow through every single step of a worked example.
\par
\subsection{Open Access and Reproducibility}

\par
Essential pillars of research. It's essential to teach students how to perform reproducible research in their early careers.~ 
\par
Designed an R Markdown template with a standard structure and a template for the term paper
\par
\href{https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JQLNCT}{https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JQLNCT}
\par
\subsection{Assignments}

\par
Practical skills are best learned when practices. To confidently write code, learners need time for practice and exercise that exceeds executing prewritten lines of code.
\par
Practice outside of class by (1) external learning sources; (2) assigning continuous homework submissions, and (3) requiring progress during the group work. 
\par
Use learnr and swearl
\par
Preselected optional advanced courses that are listed in the syllabus. 
\par
\subsection{Hackathon}

\par
Host a Hackathon for students to polish their work. Hackathons foster independent learning through applications.
\par
\subsection{Presenting results as a mini-conference}

\par
Students presented their final visualisations. Students present the relevance of their topic, their individual research questions, and the theoretical reasoning driving their work. Using peer feedback as a component in teaching is beneficial because it empowers students to think about and relfect on both their work and others' work.
\par
\subsection{Final paper}

\par
Visualization framed in a research note (2000 words) containing (1) research question, (2) short literature review and theoretical assumptions, (3) detailed discussion of their research design, (4) their interpretation.
\par
Goal was to work confidently with R to generate descriptive statistics.
\par
\subsection{Conclusions}

\par
Increasingly attractive data-related professions such as data science, data engineering, and data analytics require transferable skills and goal-oriented working behaviour.
\par
Course equips students with an essential skill: Formulating search requests that enable them to find answers to questions themselves, which has been one of the most challening components of the course. Students are equipped with their research project, which they can use later to demonstrate their skills.},

The author offers insights with regard to ideas, old and new, about science, and their historical origins in philosophy and sociology of science, which is of interest to a broad readership. The book shows that scientifically grounded knowledge is required and helpful in understanding intellectual and political positions in various discussions on the grand challenges of our time and how science makes impact on society. The book reveals why interventions that look good or even obvious, are often met with resistance and are hard to realize in practice. Based on a thorough analysis, as well as personal experiences in aids research, university administration and as a science observer, the author provides - while being totally open regarding science's limitations- a realistic narrative about how research is conducted, and how reliable `objective' knowledge is produced. His idea of science, which draws heavily on American pragmatism, fits in with the global Open Science movement. It is argued that Open Science is a truly and historically unique movement in that it translates the analysis of the problems of science into major institutional actions of system change in order to improve academic culture and the impact of science, engaging all actors in the field of science and academia.},

We evaluate a Kenyan project in which school-based mass treatment with deworming drugs was randomly phased into schools, rather than to individuals, allowing estimation of overall program effects. The program reduced school absenteeism in treatment schools by one-quarter, and was far cheaper than alternative ways of boosting school participation. Deworming substantially improved health and school participation among untreated children in both treatment schools and neighboring schools, and these externalities are large enough to justify fully subsidizing treatment. Yet we do not find evidence that deworming improved academic test scores.},

The present study reveals huge amounts of household uncollected waste released into the natural environment outside the official statistics of rural dumpsites. Despite the expansion of waste collection coverage towards rural areas since 2010, the problem of illegal dumping practice is difficult to solve. The improvement of collection efficiency, better law enforcement, and surveillance of environmental authorities coupled with educational and environmental awareness are necessary steps to combat this bad practice. A circular economy paradigm must be enacted in rural regions through separate collection schemes and to improve cost-efficient alternatives, such as home composting, and traditional and creative reuse practices, particularly in less developed regions.},

The present study reveals huge amounts of household uncollected waste released into the natural environment outside the official statistics of rural dumpsites. Despite the expansion of waste collection coverage towards rural areas since 2010, the problem of illegal dumping practice is difficult to solve. The improvement of collection efficiency, better law enforcement, and surveillance of environmental authorities coupled with educational and environmental awareness are necessary steps to combat this bad practice. A circular economy paradigm must be enacted in rural regions through separate collection schemes and to improve cost-efficient alternatives, such as home composting, and traditional and creative reuse practices, particularly in less developed regions.},

However, recycling activities and thermal energy recoveries have been initiated in a few countries [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/20/htm#B162-sustainability-14-00020}{162}},\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/20/htm#B249-sustainability-14-00020}{249}},\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/20/htm#B250-sustainability-14-00020}{250}}]. Waste management services in Africa commonly rely on a combination of small-scale, low-cost, decentralized community-driven initiatives; hence, recycling activities need to be scaled up by developing and strengthening the end-use markets on the local and regional scales [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/20/htm#B162-sustainability-14-00020}{162}}].

PET bottles can have a high re-use value, for example, to package small quantities of motor oil or homemade fruit juices. The bottles can also be cut into long ribbons, which are extremely strong and can be used as garden twine or baling string. There are also some examples of bottles being used for pencil cases and decorative items, though these are labor-intensive and artisanal applications with very niche markets. Once a PET bottle becomes too dirty or damaged, it becomes a waste for which there is no market. Even industrial PET recycling facilities will reject PET bottles that are too contaminated or sun-damaged. The value of plastics collected for recycling is often coupled with the global price of oil [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/20/htm#B312-sustainability-14-00020}{312}}], and it is almost always those at the beginning of the value chain who are impacted by price fluctuations. In Kenya, for example, a waste collector has to collect 30 two-liter PET bottles to earn the equivalent of 5 cents (USD). This is in part due to the lack of PET recycling infrastructure and the large number of middlemen and significant transport costs incurred to deliver PET to a recycling facility. It is not possible to recycle PET using simple, low-cost, and low-tech processing equipment. Its high melting point (250 \textdegree C) and glass transition temperature (circa 70 \textdegree C) mean it does not melt or blend well with other polymers [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/1/20/htm#B313-sustainability-14-00020}{313}}]. Furthermore, it is a crystalline polymer, so after melting and reforming, the product is cloudy and brittle, with very few potential applications. Since PET is mostly used in food-grade applications, finding a suitable market for PET that is no longer of food-grade standard remains challenging, and so PET remains one of the most visibly littered items in areas with no waste management system.},

This paper addresses the need to rethink the meaning of work in the context of neoliberal capitalism by exploring the formation of new worker subjectivities and practices among catadores: informal workers who collect and sell recyclable materials on a garbage dump in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Based on ethnographic research conducted among catadores from June through August of 2005 and in January 2007, this paper provides an analysis of the labor conditions, social relations, and forms of political organizing that have emerged on the garbage dump and which differ in significant ways from those found in situations of formal wage labor. Ultimately, this paper argues that while neoliberal capitalism has led to increased unemployment and underemployment among vulnerable populations in cities worldwide, the practices of those struggling to earn a living in urban informal economies are creating new spaces for alternative economic practices, social relations, and class politics today.},

Many methods have been developed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of concrete. These methods range from the replacement of inefficient manufacturing equipment to alternative binders and the use of breakthrough technologies; nevertheless, many of these methods have barriers to implementation. In this research, we examine the extent to which the increased use of several currently implemented methods can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in concrete material production without requiring new technologies, changes in production, or novel material use. This research shows that, through increased use of common supplementary cementitious materials, appropriate selection of proportions for cement replacement, and increased concrete design age, 24\% of greenhouse gas emissions from global concrete production or 650 million tonnes (Mt) CO2-eq can be eliminated annually.},

We argue in this article that Cape Town's crisis of water scarcity was a product of the convergence of ongoing contradictions in South African water governance as they came into contact with shifting infrastructural priorities associated with climate change. In its response to the possibility of a financial crisis brought on by reduced water consumption, the city withdrew the universal provision of free basic water (FBW) and reconfigured existing tariff structures. Both changes meant that the city moved further into commercialization and valuation practices in the context of restricted monetary flows. Based on an understanding of contemporary governance in South Africa as reflective of an often contradictory need to balance municipal budgets while also correcting for apartheid inequities, we argue that ongoing experiences of climate change are stretching existing municipal budgets in ways that threaten to deepen existing inequalities. Ultimately, we suggest that Cape Town's crisis is critical for understanding how climate change is reconfiguring existing governance dynamics at a planetary scale, thus offering insights into what form urban climate change adaptation may take in the future.},

In the context of municipal solid waste (MSW) management, considering that developing countries aim to implement circular economy (CE) actions, it is essential to ensure the inclusion of waste pickers (catadores) in an adapted CE structure. This study analyzes the integration of recycling cooperatives in the formal management of municipal solid waste with recyclable potential (MSWRP) of a medium-sized municipality in Brazil, with the objective of ascertaining the contributions of cooperatives in an adapted CE structure and, at the same time, identifying a cooperative that can be used as a benchmarking option for other cooperatives, especially in relation to their organizational and operational practices. The results indicate that from this integration, cooperatives have legal responsibility in the management of MSWRP, resulting in the professionalization of its members and increasing their productivity. The results also revealed that the implementation of the CE in developing countries is, in a sense, conditioned to the performance of the informal sector in the recycling chain and, in addition, that the inclusion of cooperatives in the formal sector of MSWRP management can improve the rates of a municipality.},

The integration of value creation and recovery activities into retail customer value propositions is, however, under researched and raises many challenges, especially in Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) retail where few real-world examples have been published. The recent emergence of the term `circular economy' has initiated further debate about closed loop value propositions and closed loop supply chain implications. This paper selects four circular economy-led closed loop product case examples from a major European FMCG company, and assesses, at a high level, how these cases created value, for whom value was created, and key challenges in their implementation. The findings highlight that each case is different. Closing loops and creating successful value propositions is complex and requires simultaneous reconfiguration of key building blocks to ensure customer acceptance and business viability. The paper proposes the term `circular supply chain' for cases where circular economy principles are explicitly incorporated in CLSC for value creation.},

To avert the impact of P future uncertainty a P flow analysis (PFA) was conducted to characterise and quantify sources, flows, and sinks of P to determine options for waste minimisation, recovery, and chemical fertiliser use reduction for Malawi. The PFA results highlighted that; there are 35000 Mg of recyclable organic P annually, which is over two times Malawi's annual P fertiliser demand (14000 Mg). Currently, only 16\% of the organic P is recycled to agriculture. Chemical P fertiliser represents 66 \% of the P fertiliser used for crop production. Manure is the most recycled organic P source (38 \% recycled), followed by organic solid waste (6\%), and crop residues (5\%). Annually, 9000 Mg of P is transferred to faecal matter, but none is recycled. Overall, Malawian soils have a negative P balance of -4000 Mg. Malawi can reduce its dependence on imported chemical P if recycling of organic P source is adopted. However, regulations should be put in place to control the quality of organic fertilisers.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in air. These particles typically consist of a mixture of inorganic and organic chemicals, including carbon, sulfates, nitrates, metals, acids, and semi-volatile compounds. The size of PM in air ranges from approximately 0.005 to 100 micrometers (\textmu m) in diameter -- the size of just a few atoms to about the thickness of a human hair. Researchers have defined size categories for these particles differently. PM is defined by three general categories commonly used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA): coarse (10 to 2.5 \textmu m), fine (2.5 \textmu m or smaller), and ultrafine (0.1 \textmu m or smaller). Research suggests that particle size is an important factor that influences how particles deposit in the respiratory tract and affect human health. Coarse particles are deposited almost exclusively in the nose and throat; whereas, fine and ultrafine particles generally are able to penetrate to deep areas of the lung. Fine and ultrafine particles are present in greater numbers and have greater surface area than larger particles of the same mass, and they are generally considered to be more toxic. Most countries contribute to aiborne particulate matter pollution in other countries. In the past couple of years particulate matter has recieved media attention, concequential to the discovery of thousand of people dying young of particulate matter introduced health effects. This includes both short-term and long-term effects. Particulate matter does not only cause health effects, it also plays a role in the green house effect and global warming because of its contribution to cloud formation. Particulate matter is released from natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, sea salt, or soils. Anthropogenic sources, such as car exhausts, industry, shipping and coal and ore fabrication, cause increases in airborne particulate matter concentrations on many locations. Deposition of these particulate matters on vegetated surfaces depend on the size distribution of these particles and effects of particulate matter on vegetation may be associated with the reduction in light required for photosynthesis and increase in leaf temperature due to changed surface optical properties.},

Specific features of the programme, in both its first and second phase, are described thoroughly to provide readers with an appropriate understanding and appreciation of the details of RPS. A brief overview of the current state of social protection in Nicaragua is also included to enhance understanding of the current environment in the country. In particular, this study discusses the elements that contributed to the programme's successes and eventual discontinuation. Although RPS achieved most of its goals, it was unable to garner enough domestic support to ensure its continuation. While the programme was known internationally for the positive effects it quickly had on children's health and education, its purpose and performance were misunderstood at the domestic level. This lack of appreciation heightened criticisms of RPS and hindered support for the programme within its institutional base. RPS is an example of an efficient and effective conditional cash transfer programme, but it also serves as a warning to officials operating in similar contexts. RPS officials had to balance the demands of domestic and international stakeholders, meeting short-term goals while ensuring the initiative's longterm viability. The Nicaraguan experience usefully illustrates the challenges involved in creating an exemplary programme and ensuring its long-term sustainability.},

  abstract = {Light absorption by aerosols contributes to solar radiative forcing through absorption of solar radiation and heating of the absorbing aerosol layer. Besides the direct radiative effect, the heating can evaporate clouds and change the atmospheric dynamics. Aerosol light absorption in the atmosphere is dominated by black carbon (BC) with additional, significant contributions from the still poorly understood brown carbon and from mineral dust. Sources of these absorbing aerosols include biomass burning and other combustion processes and dust entrainment. For particles much smaller than the wavelength of incident light, absorption is proportional to the particle volume and mass. Absorption can be calculated with Mie theory for spherical particles and with more complicated numerical methods for other particle shapes. The quantitative measurement of aerosol light absorption is still a challenge. Simple, commonly used filter measurements are prone to measurement artifacts due to particle concentration and modification of particle and filter morphology upon particle deposition, optical interaction of deposited particles and filter medium, and poor angular integration of light scattered by deposited particles. In situ methods measure particle absorption with the particles in their natural suspended state and therefore are not prone to effects related to particle deposition and concentration on filters. Photoacoustic and refractive index-based measurements rely on the heating of particles during light absorption, which, for power-modulated light sources, causes an acoustic signal and modulation of the refractive index in the air surrounding the particles that can be quantified with a microphone and an interferometer, respectively. These methods may suffer from some interference due to light-induced particle evaporation. Laser-induced incandescence also monitors particle heating upon absorption, but heats absorbing particles to much higher temperatures to quantify BC mass from the thermal radiation emitted by the heated particles. Extinction-minus-scattering techniques have limited sensitivity for measuring aerosol light absorption unless the very long absorption paths of cavity ring-down techniques are used. Systematic errors can be dominated by truncation errors in the scattering measurement for large particles or by subtraction errors for high single scattering albedo particles. Remote sensing techniques are essential for global monitoring of aerosol light absorption. While local column-integrated measurements of aerosol light absorption with sun and sky radiometers are routinely done, global satellite measurements are so far largely limited to determining a semi-quantitative UV absorption index.},

  abstract = {The concept of hegemonic masculinity has had a profound impact on gender activism and has been taken up particularly in health interventions. The concept was part of a conceptual gendered vocabulary about men which opened up analytical space for research on masculinity and prompted a generation of gender interventions with men. Academic work focused primarily on relations between men, to the neglect of relations with women, while paradoxically acknowledging the power that men had over women. Interventions that drew on theories of masculinities focused on the content of hegemonic masculinity, identifying hegemony with oppressive attitudes and practices. Hegemonic masculinity was considered singular and universal, with little acknowledgment given to research-based work that argued for a model of multiple hegemonic masculinities. An unintended consequence of efforts to promote gender equity through a focus on men and hegemony has been a recent popular discursive backlash. In this, Jacob Zuma and Julius Malema, presidents of the African National Congress (ANC) and the ANC youth league respectively, have sought to valorize an African masculinity that is race-specific, backward-looking, and predicated on the notion of male superiority. In this article, the authors argue that the concept of hegemonic masculinities retains a utility in both scholarship and activism but that its use needs to be located within a broader gendered understanding of society which in turn needs to confront race and class-based national realities.},

This formative study in rural Malawi used a theoretical base to determine the personal, social, environmental, and psychosocial factors that are to be considered in the development of an integrated intervention for WASH and food hygiene. Using a mixed methods approach, a stakeholder analysis was followed by data collection pertaining to 1079 children between the ages of four to 90 weeks: observations (n = 79); assessment of risks, attitudes, norms and self-regulation (RANAS) model (n = 323); structured questionnaires (n = 1000); focus group discussions (n = 9); and, in-depth interviews (n = 9) (PACTR201703002084166). We identified four thematic areas for the diarrheal disease intervention: hand washing with soap; food hygiene; feces management (human and animal); and, water management. The contextual issues included: the high level of knowledge on good hygiene practices not reflected in observed habits; inclusion of all family members incorporating primary caregivers (female) and financial controllers (male); and, endemic poverty as a significant barrier to hygiene infrastructure and consumable availability. The psychosocial factors identified for intervention development included social norms, abilities, and self-regulation.

Conducted from February to December 2018 in rural Malawi, this before and after trial with a control used diarrhoeal disease as a primary outcome, to measure the impact of a food hygiene intervention (food hygiene + handwashing) relative to a food hygiene and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) intervention (food hygiene + handwashing + faeces management + water management). The 31-week intervention was delivered by community-based coordinators through community events (n = 2), cluster group meetings (n = 17) and household visits (n = 14). Diarrhoeal disease was self-reported and measured through an end line survey, and daily diaries completed by caregivers. Difference-in-differences results show a 13-percentage point reduction in self-reported diarrhoea compared to the control group. There were also significant increases in the presence of proxy measures in each of the treatment groups (e.g., the presence of soap). We conclude that food hygiene interventions (including hand washing with soap) can significantly reduce diarrhoeal disease prevalence in children under five years in a low-income setting. Therefore, the promotion of food hygiene practices using a behaviour-centred approach should be embedded in nutrition and WASH policies and programming.},

  abstract = {Waste management is a global phenomenon and a challenge to all nations. There is a need to ensure that waste is handled in an environmental friendly and healthy manner. The high rate of unemployment in South Africa leads to elevated poverty, which is one of the most serious socio-economic problems in developing countries. This leads to people opting to work anywhere, particularly in the informal sector for survival. Waste picking is classified as a type of informal employment. In South Africa, the last stage in the life cycle of waste disposal is at the landfill sites. Landfill sites are normally located on the outskirts of towns and away from communities for safety and health reasons. This study researched the working conditions and health status of waste pickers working at some landfill sites in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality, namely Ga-Rankuwa, Onderstepoort and Hatherly. The study used a multi method approach, where both qualitative and quantitative factors of research were utilized. Data was gathered through survey questionnaire with a sample of 176 waste pickers at three landfill sites, together with unstructured interviews with municipal workers. The researcher also observed how waste pickers work at the landfill sites. Some of the findings of this study are that:  About 66 \% of waste pickers at the landfill sites were females with an average age of 45 years.  A majority (93 \%) of waste pickers did not reach matric and were not employable in the formal sector.  Most waste pickers (53\%) work 5 days and a few (41\%) work 6 days per week.  Only 22\% of participants reported injury at work and 41\% consulted the clinic or hospital due to injury or illness. Descriptive statistical results of the study revealed that waste pickers view their health to be fair as compared to their peers but were not satisfied with their working conditions. Waste pickers are aware of stigma including health challenges associated with working at a landfill site and the need of acting appropriately in protecting themselves.},

This paper presents findings of a study to evaluate the global warming potential of urban houses built of three different building materials. The International Organization for Standardization life-cycle environmental impact assessment approach was used. To obtain lifecycle inventory, process inventory analysis was used, focusing on energy inputs and carbon outputs at the initial construction stage. A functional unit of a 1m2 wall was used for calculating energy and carbon emissions. The results demonstrate that, for individual blocks, kiln burnt bricks (KBBs) consume 0.531 GJ/m2 compared to 0.138 GJ/m2 and 0.106 GJ/m2 for stabilized soil-cement blocks (SSBs) and solid cement blocks (SCBs) respectively. Similarly, KBBs have a higher global warming potential than the SCBs and SSBs. When cement or lime joint and plaster mortars are included, the KBBs contain the highest values for the energy consumed and CO2 emitted. The results suggest the need to switch from KBBs to other energy and carbon efficient materials, as well as a call to sound sectoral policy to tackle the effects of climate change in Malawi and beyond.},

SOWATT was used to evaluate options for Blantyre's Limbe Market. Anaerobic digestion, black soldier fly processing, slow pyrolysis, in-vessel composting, windrow composting, vermicomposting, and wet-biomass-briquetting were considered as options. The performance of each alternative was assessed based on five objectives by government, NGO, and market-based stakeholders in order to determine the most acceptable option for the greatest number of people: something that is rarely done, or if it is the preferences are not rigorously quantified (e.g., stakeholder workshops) and/or weighted against specific objectives. However, given the novelty of the ranking-solicitation process, some participants struggled with the variety of options presented, and further iterations of SOWATT will address this limitation. Ultimately, vermicomposting scored highest of all alternatives and could best achieve the five objectives as prioritized by the stakeholders when implemented.},

Unfortunately, pit-emptying is rarely practiced due to factors related to accessibility, disgust, and importantly, cost. We examined the impact of two different types of vouchers distributed in Blantyre, Malawi, to understand if and how subsidies could increase the practice of pit emptying in low-income areas. We found that pit emptying businesses were able to game the system to charge more money on top of the discount in the first study in which 21\% vouchers were redeemed from 252 distributed. In a follow-up study, 25\% vouchers were redeemed from 400 distributed with more rigorous subsidy targeting and structuring.

  abstract = {Similar to other poor countries across Africa, Malawi struggles with solid waste management (SWM). Especially considering the high proportion of organic waste, composting is a promising opportunity to tackle the problem. However, composting has had low uptake due to competing fertilizer subsidies, the perceived labour required, and a lack of training and equipment. Considering these issues, this paper presents an analysis of the political dynamics around SWM at markets in Blantyre, Malawi, and to understand how these dynamics may potentially affect the sorting of organic waste in order to improve the production of compost. We find complex systems of both formal and informal management that are deeply linked to the official political structures, creating a diverse array of actors with various vested interests. Implementing a separation program would need community engagement and long-term financial viability to ensure that the project is not abandoned as others have been. This paper contributes to understanding how the complexity of urban governance, combined with party politics, can affect the potential for introducing new models of waste management. It emphasises the importance of understanding both informal and formal management structures before designing interventions.},

  abstract = {Small towns are growing in size and number, but compared to the big cities that fuel economies, or rural areas that feed nations, small towns are generally less prioritized by governments and donors, both because they appear less immediately troublesome and because they defy easy classification. As such, growth has largely been unplanned for and remains unregulated, which means that responsible governments lack the commensurate tax base and political might to plan for and aquire the services they need to handle the changes that they face. For exactly these reasons, the Community-Led Urban Environmental Sanitation (CLUES) tool was developed to assist small towns with the planning and implementation of environmental sanitation infrastructure and services but we found no documented cases of it being used or evaluated. The goals of this work were to first, document the information obtained from the CLUES process as a case study for the condition of environmental sanitation in a small town in Malawi; and secondly, to evaluate the technical, political, and financial feasibility of the CLUES manual in a Malawian context. As facilitators, we guided the community and government through each of the 7 CLUES steps over the course of 2 years to understand the actual demands of the guidelines from the perspective of the user. Once the process was completed, we were able to critically reflect on our stated objectives and present those results here. The results of the process revealed that water quality was good (no measured E. coli at 45 water points) as was access to a sanitation facility, though water quantity was insufficient and fecal sludge management and solid waste collection required Council attention. However, because baseline data were outdated or non-existent, the data collection activities required to determine the status consumed unexpected amounts of time, and the results were, because of internal movement and politics, difficult to disseminate and leverage. Most importantly, stakeholder participation was limited and relied on participation and transportation payments, which have become a permanent feature of community development in Malawi. Following the CLUES process was expensive, time consuming and politically fraught; it is unlikely that any small town in Malawi would be able to follow the process as outlined. A simplified version, conducted by an in-house planning department should focus on identifying gaps, needs, and priorities, as a way of not only addressing environmental sanitation issues, but as a way to kick-start better data collection and management that can underscore long-term planning activities.},

  abstract = {Solid waste management remains a challenge globally attributed to several factors including inadequacies and ineffectiveness of policies. Presumably, good policies should translate to better solid waste management prac\- tices. However, other underlying factors and implementation challenges may determine the waste management status. Thus the debate in the literature on solid waste management policy and practice remains inconclusive. Based on literature review, this paper examines the discourse on solid waste management regulation and status in Sub-Saharan Africa. A paradox of policy outcomes is revealed at global and national level. Global policies have not been holistically contextualised and integrated in national policies. While national policies have not improved the solid waste management status of some countries, in others, it has, albeit unsustainably. Notably, inherent weaknesses such as insufficiency, homogeneity and ambiguity of policies affects implementation. This is exacerbated by poor enforcement strategies, lack of participatory mechanisms, inadequate sensitisation, influ\- ence of power and politics, as well as weak political commitment, among others. To ensure smart and clean cities, it is crucial for initiatives of solid waste management not only to be legally supported, but also contextualised and co-generated. For effective policy implementation, there is need for sensitisation of urban dwellers to enable comprehension of policies. Participatory strategies and governments' commitment towards solid waste man\- agement should be paramount. Due to rapid changes in urban areas, periodic studies on content and context inferences such as solid waste collection practices and participation of actors in the informal settlements are required to dispel the practice of homogenising policies in order to enhance relevancy and suitability.},

This study aimed to: (a) quantify, (b) characterize solid wastes, (c) assess potential for on-site reuse and off-site recycling practices at household and suburb levels, and d) evaluate the possible economic benefits that could accrue from on-site reuse and off-site recycling practices in Dangamvura (low-income), Yeovil (middle-income) and Hospital Hill (high-income) suburbs in Mutare City in Zimbabwe. Solid waste was measured from 23 households per suburb. Pre-tested, self-administered questionnaires were used for determining on-site waste handling practices. Weighing scales were used for waste quantification. Results indicated that at least 70\% of residents in Dangamvura neither reused waste nor practiced off-site recycling of litter. Between 50\% and 80\% of people claimed to practice waste reuse and off-site recycling in Yeovil and Hospital Hill respectively. However, about 84\% recyclables were found in the waste bins of the sampled households across all three suburbs. The readily recyclables (plastic, paper, metal cans) constituted 44\%, potentially recyclables (glass and organic waste)-40\% and others-16\%. The clear discrepancy of generated solid waste quantities obtained from interview responses and validated weight data indicated a need to substantiate data from questionnaires with actual waste measurements. Through improper waste handling, Dangamvura loses nearly US\$45, 000/month potential income from the readily recyclables. This money could provide an income of approximately US\$500/month for 90 families. Municipal authorities must collect recyclables from a whole suburb rather than individual households as a viable waste management and poverty alleviation strategy to sustain livelihoods and minimise health hazards in developing countries such as Zimbabwe.},

  abstract = {This research was prompted by the apparent lack of innovation in the South African construction industry. The aim was to obtain a better understanding of the state of innovation. The strategy involved engaging construction contractors in the mining industry to obtain information regarding their view of innovation in the construction industry. Data was collected following a mixed-method strategy. A literature review, interviews, a focus group and questionnaires formed part of the data-gathering strategy.  A number of findings emerged from the study, notably that innovation is important for a contractor to facilitate differentiation, and to be more competitive. The industry has high levels of competition and low entry barriers. Relationships are complex, with clients demanding complex structures to operate at low cost and within tight schedules. Levels of investment in research and development (R\&D) are generally low. There are not enough experienced and trained role-players, and the level of trust between role-players needs to be strengthened.  Cooperation between industry and academics, and investment in R\&D is insufficient. Government focuses too much on the empowerment of previously disadvantaged individuals, ignoring the innovation history and experience of potential contractors, which means that contractors are not motivated to be innovative. As a legislator, government is viewed as hampering innovation by not ensuring that the training of artisans is up to standard, by enforcing labour laws which do not allow for the easy transfer of skilled employees, and by neglecting to assist underperforming apprentices in improving their skills.},

Financial records showed that the WUA collected only 26\% of their expected payments in 2018. Over 94\% of the WUA members lacked the necessary capacity to manage contracts and human resources and only 16\% of the Community Water Point Committees were trained in relevant areas of management. Several key positions had been unfilled and the parts necessary for repairs were unavailable. This is one of the few ex-post evaluations of a GFRPWSS and highlights several key issues for those wishing to implement similar schemes. Findings showed that the water system only partially met the water requirements of the customers, that the WUA struggled technically and operationally to maintain the system and that at the time of the study, the system was financially unsustainable. Improved record-keeping and payment collection, especially if and when quantities are increased, would likely improve all dimensions of sustainability.},

Specifically, the article addresses this question in two ways: first, by examining the evolving conceptions and perceptions of space in Malawi; second, by analysing the link between the changing conceptions and perceptions with urban planning and its associated representations and spatial practices. Using archival and secondary data, the article documents the underexplored history of urban planning policy in Malawi in three historical moments namely: the pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial eras; before delving into the shifting conceptions of planning from the colonial to post-colonial Malawi using Lilongwe city as a case study.},

An emerging industry standard for FSTUs includes as a key criteria energy independence in steady-state. Theoretically, there is sufficient thermal energy available in fecal sludge to provide the electrical power needed to run the FSTU. However, such a system had never been implemented. Methods : Biomass Controls has previously demonstrated the thermal treatment of fecal sludge using the Biogenic Refinery, a thermal FSTU deployed in three sites in India. In this article we describe testing where a Biogenic Refinery was paired with a thermal fluid heat exchanger and organic Rankine cycle generator to generate electrical power. Results : This Biogenic Refinery combined heat and power system generated sufficient electrical power to offset electrical parasitic loads in steady-state operation and produce a surplus of 1.2 kWe. Conclusions : The results of the study demonstrate that there is an excess of energy available and reliable mechanisms to generate electrical energy using an FSTU. Additional steps are necessary to transition to a true off-grid FSTU.},

  abstract = {[This article analyzes the processes by which informal recyclers in periurban Managua, Nicaragua turned salvaged aluminum into pots, pans, and decorative items. It situates such artisanal aluminum recycling in a context of what Burawoy (1996) and Davis (2004) call "economic involution." Recycling proliferated in a post-revolutionary Nicaraguan economy in which an already fledgling industrial metalworks sector had nearly collapsed; in which flexible export capitalism and tourism were growing; and in which informal production was also expanding. From the perspective of aluminum artisans, the honing of skills (smelting, sculpting, molding, and alloying) was a creative response to this trend. Even after the return to power of a nominally pro-poor Sandinista government in 2007, recyclers continued to self-consciously style themselves as artisanal laborers (obradores artesanales). The recyclers avoided formal associations such as Sandinista cooperatives and private microcredit schemes. Drawing on fieldwork carried out in two artisanal aluminum shops between 2008 and 2011, the article guides readers through the recycling labor process, revealing the ways in which these urban craft laborers came to see embodied skills as potential sources of value and potential pathways to a middle class and tourist markets.]}

  abstract = {Open-burning of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a major source of PM emissions in developing world cities, but few studies have characterized this phenomenon at the city and intracity (neighborhood) scale relevant to human health impacts. This paper develops a consistent field method for measuring the spatial frequency of the incidence of MSW-burning and presents results in three neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic status (SES) in Delhi, India, observed in winter and summer over 2 years. Daily MSW-burning incidents ranged from 24 to 130/km2-day during winter and 5-87/km2-day during summer, with the highest intensity in low SES neighborhoods. Distinct seasonal and diurnal patterns are observed. The daily mass of MSW-burned was also estimated at 90-1170 kg/km2-day and 13-1100 kg/km2-day in highest to low SES neighborhoods, in winter and summer, respectively. The scaled-up estimate of total MSW-burned for Delhi city ranged from 190 to 246 tons/day, about 2\%-3\% of total generated MSW; morning-burning contributed {$>$}65\% of the total. MSW composition varied systematically across neighborhoods and season. Agra had much higher MSW-burning (39-202 incidents/km2-day; 672-3485 kg/km2-day) in the summer. The field method thus captures differences in MSW-burning across cities, neighborhoods, diurnally and seasonally, important for more fine grained air pollution modeling, and for tracking/monitoring policy effectiveness on-ground.},

This paper examines various approaches to implementing EPR for various types of packaging waste in South Africa, focusing in particular on their effectiveness in stimulating the recovery of post-consumer packaging material for recycling. In particular, the approaches adopted in the plastic bag, steel beverage can, glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) industries are examined. It is found that voluntary industry initiatives (as in the can, glass and PET industries) can be effective in stimulating recovery in a developing country context. By contrast, in the South African case, mandatory, government-imposed regulations (as in the plastic bag industry) have not been effective in stimulating recovery. However, this does not imply that voluntary initiatives are always more effective than mandatory regulations. Instead, it is likely that the differing results for plastic bags as opposed to other packaging waste streams in South Africa can be explained by the differing characteristics of the former; in particular, their reusability (particularly for bin liners) and low recycling value relative to the other waste streams. In addition, in the case of glass and PET, a major incentive behind the voluntary initiatives was the desire to avoid punitive regulations like those imposed in the plastic bag industry. It could therefore be argued that mandatory regulations in the plastic bag industry had the indirect effect of stimulating recovery in the glass and PET industries.},

Methods\textemdash Primary schools from within each of seven communities in two regions of Durban (the highly industrialised south compared with the non-industrial north) were selected. Children from randomly selected grade 4 classrooms were invited to participate. Standardised interviews, spirometry, methacholine challenge testing and skin-prick testing were conducted. Particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide were monitored at each school, while nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other pollutants were monitored at other sites. Results\textemdash SO2 was significantly higher in the south than in the north, while PM concentrations were similar across the city. The prevalence of symptoms consistent with asthma of any severity was 32.1\%. Covariate-adjusted prevalences were higher among children from schools in the south than among those from the north for persistent asthma (12.2\% v. 9.6 \%) and for marked airway hyperreactivity (AHR) (8.1\% v. 2.8\%), while SO2 resulted in a twofold increased risk of marked AHR (95\% confidence interval 0.98 \textendash{} 4.66; p=0.056). Conclusions\textemdash Schoolchildren from industrially exposed communities experienced higher covariate-adjusted prevalences of persistent asthma and marked AHR than children from communities distant from industrial sources. Our findings are strongly suggestive of industrial pollution-related adverse respiratory health effects among these children.},

Both the informal sectors (garbage collectors, waste pickers, waste dealers, small stores and itinerant merchants) and the households in India, play a vital role in recovering consumer waste. In order to have an in-depth understanding, a case study has been performed to better understand the contribution of households, garbage collectors and itinerant waste merchants towards recovering consumer waste. Our study shows that consumer waste is far more efficiently recovered in India than what has been reported in literature until now.

Despite the potential for synergies and the opportunities to maximize positive interactions, there have been few attempts to break the existing sectoral silos in order to integrate these three service chains.

In addition, citizen science applications such as personal exposure monitoring can be implemented effortlessly. However, the reliability of the data is questionable due to various error sources involved in the LCS measurement. Furthermore, sensor performance drift over time is another issue. Hence, the adoption of LCS by regulatory agencies is still evolving. Several studies have been conducted to improve the performance of low-cost sensors. This article summarizes the existing studies on the state-of-the-art of LCS for AQM. We conceptualize a step by step procedure to establish a sustainable AQM setup with LCS that can produce reliable data. The selection of sensors, calibration and evaluation, hardware setup, evaluation metrics and inferences, and end user-specific applications are various stages in the LCS-based AQM setup we propose. We present a critical analysis at every step of the AQM setup to obtain reliable data from the low-cost measurement. Finally, we conclude this study with future scope to improve the availability of air quality data.},

The article considers the ways scavengers function within the broader context of waste management; they show a wide range of locally formed and adapted activities and social systems. Examples from different cultures are included: the United States, Jamaica, Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia. The authors advocate comparative research and find a contextual, holistic approach to be the most appropriate. Using such an approach, they isolate the important factors that characterize these systems: technical, socio-cultural, socio-political and organizational aspects are elaborated. Experiments in intervention have been undertaken at various levels, from varying ideological and theoretical backgrounds. Academic analyses have ranged from neo-Marxist political economy models to neo-liberal development approaches. As expressed in the title the authors conclude that informal waste management systems are unjustifiably considered problematic whereas they often reveal great development potential.}

  abstract = {Summary The informal economy currently provides two out of three jobs worldwide, with waste-picking activities providing employment for millions of the poorest of society. Moreover, waste-picking could provide a sustainable solution for solving the waste management crisis that affects the 3 billion people lacking access to waste services. Governmental policies toward waste-pickers in particular, and the informal economy in general, have been fundamentally based on four policy approaches: (1) dualist and voluntarist, which proposes repressive policies against waste-picker activity and the expansion of formal solid waste management systems; (2) structuralist, which argues for weak supporting policies aimed at reinforcing waste-picker associations; (3) legalist, which promotes the competition of waste-picking with other recycling alternatives without government intervention; and (4) co-production, which supports waste-picking with local policies as a means of enhancing waste-pickers' productivity. Both qualitative, and particularly quantitative evidence testing the impact of these four approaches is scarce. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by operationalizing concepts, building a waste-picker sustainable performance index, and estimating the impacts of these four competing policy approaches. An exploratory sequential design method is used to analyze data: first, a thematic analysis to examine 40 in-depth interviews, and then multiple linear regressions to analyze a census survey of 100 waste-pickers in four cooperatives in Santiago de Chile. Our empirical results suggest a positive association between the level of government support and waste-pickers' sustainable performance. Consequently, further positive government intervention, particularly in supporting a stronger structural organization for the waste-picker recycling system, is advocated as the primary policy recommendation of this paper.},

Three stages have been conceptualised in the imposition of a neoliberal creative-destructive process: proto-neoliberalism, roll-back and roll-out periods. Empirical studies have traditionally analysed this process by examining a single urban policy's evolution over time. In this paper, we go beyond these types of studies by performing a systemic analysis of multiple urban policy reforms in Santiago, Chile. We use a genealogical thematic analysis to track changes in laws, government programmes and planning documents from between 1952 and 2014. Our analysis identifies different ?urban systems of accumulation? by looking at the interplay of four urban policies: (1) urban planning deregulation; (2) social housing privatisation; (3) devolution of territorial taxes; and (4) decreased public service provision. Moreover, our multidimensional policy analysis in Santiago characterises a more radical, fourth expression in the creative destruction process of ?accumulation by dismantling?. Consequently, we advocate for more multidimensional urban policy research that goes beyond a three-period analysis in order to gain a deeper understanding of contemporary neoliberal creative-destructive processes in variegated geographies.},

With this study, we seek to assess various aspects of formal and informal waste recycling in Pakistan through an inductive qualitative research design by examining the case of one of the most populous cities, Lahore, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Equal representation to various stakeholders is accorded, with 25 interviews each with managers of private companies, public companies, waste pickers and scrap dealers in the target area. The study highlights that recycling sector in Pakistan is completely informal and unregulated with no or little support available due to a lack of funds and systematic planning. The empirical evidence suggests that the formal sector lacks the capacity for proper waste disposal of total waste generated. The recycling aspects are left to informal sector stakeholders who improvise to extract value from MSW in an entrepreneurial manner. The formal sector holds a bias towards informal stakeholders due to the fact that their work also serves as a theft bargain and resale platform under the guise of waste collection and recycling. The study highlights the most and least sought after recyclables, identifies gray channel markets of spare parts, metal recycling and counterfeit products, and practices of adulteration in the target area. This study recommends as a policy input, to overcome bias towards the informal sector, the creation of a central recycling commission to overlook and regulate the affairs of hitherto unregulated and informal municipal solid waste and recycling value chains.},

  abstract = {Over the years, the world was not paying strict attention to the impact of rapid growth in plastic use. This has led to unprecedented amounts of mixed types of plastic waste entering the environment unmanaged. Packaging plastics account for half of the global total plastic waste. This paper seeks to give an overview of the use, disposal, and regulation of food packaging plastics. Demand for food packaging is on the rise as a result of increasing global demand for food due to population growth. Most of the food packaging are used on-the-go and are single use plastics that are disposed of within a short space of time. The bulk of this plastic waste has found its way into the environment contaminating land, water and the food chain. The food industry is encouraged to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging materials. A wholistic approach to waste management will need to involve all stakeholders working to achieve a circular economy. A robust approach to prevent pollution today rather than handling the waste in the future should be adopted especially in Africa where there is high population growth.},

The extent of this integration was compared with interventions proposed in InteRa, a new way of evaluating the integration of informal recyclers with the waste management systems of cities in developing countries. Our results suggest that the Harare City Council, which had the vision of transforming itself into a world-class city, failed to fully integrate the informal recycling sector. We suggest to policymakers that complete integration of the informal sector will not necessarily prevent cities from achieving such visions. Rather, addressing the neglected interventions may help in achieving their visions.},

  abstract = {Fuelwood is an essential forest product for small-holder farmers in the tropics, but fuelwood harvesting may cause forest degradation and impact ecosystem services. Understanding tree species composition, diversity and biomass changes in forests with active fuelwood collection is important for informing sustainable forest harvesting. In the miombo woodlands of southern Malawi, using forest plots, we investigated: 1) if forests with fuelwood harvesting (n = 50) have different tree, sapling and seedling stem density, species diversity, species composition, and aboveground biomass (AGB) than forests with minimal use (n = 36); and 2) if forest product harvesting pressure and access are predictors of tree stem density, diversity and AGB. We found a significant reduction in tree diversity and AGB but not stem density, and different species composition in areas with fuelwood harvesting compared to reference sites. For saplings, stem density was higher and species composition was different in fuelwood harvesting sites. Seedling Shannon index and Simpson's diversity were lower in fuelwood harvesting sites. Harvesting pressure and access were predictors of AGB and tree stem density. The reduced AGB and tree species diversity may hinder collection of fuelwood and other forest products, and may reduce ecosystem functioning. Exploring the possibility of forest landscape restoration in the area could be beneficial.},

Recently, the Government of Malawi has taken the first major step to implement the national disaster risk management policy in close partnership with international aid organisations. Local communities and housing conditions are key components for achieving sustainable development and for reducing the impact of natural disasters. This study presents the results of a recent building survey conducted in Central and Southern Malawi to understand the current situation of housing construction in Malawi more accurately. The survey focussed on the informal housing construction sector with respect to seismic vulnerability. The observed characteristics of local buildings are compared with the global building classifications that are widely used for evaluating seismic vulnerability of structures. Building typologies that are defined based on international building databases and those observed in the field are different, highlighting the importance of obtaining more realistic building information for seismic risk assessment.Keywords: Building survey, building classification, seismic vulnerability},

The aim of this study was to quantify the abundance of macro-litters in the downstream of Saigon river. Plastic fraction and non-plastic fraction were classified according to river-OSPAR guideline, and then counted and weighted. As a result, plastics was the most abundance type of litter in term of amount, accounted for 86.54\% with a total of 617 items and weight witha total of 11,490.5g). Styrofoam fragments in range of 2.5\textendash 50 cm, plastic bags and plastic cups accounted for the major parts of sampled plastic items in the meanwhile LDPE, Other, and PS were found in highest proportion in terms of standard plastic classification. Additionally, top 5 brands comprising 43\% of branded litters collected in the Saigon river during the study period were PepsiCo, Acecook, Masan, Vinacafe Bien Hoa, and Nestle. This study showed the need for enhancing waste management and reducing single-use plastics to tackle plastic pollution in the Saigon river.},

It also disturbs natural processes such as biogeochemical, hydrological, and ecological cycles. In Malawi, deforestation is estimated to be responsible for the loss of 33,000 hectares per year, and is mainly attributed to agriculture expansion, tobacco growing, and excessive use of biomass. However, little research has been conducted at either the local level or that of forests located on customary land. This research aimed to identify and analyze the underlying driving factors associated with the proximate factors of agriculture expansion, tobacco growing, and brick burning in Mwazisi. Landsat images for 1991, 2004, and 2017 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey website and used to analyze changes in forest cover. Interviews with households (n = 399) and Natural Resource Committee members, a focus group discussion with key officers, and observations were conducted during field data collection in 2017. The results of the land cover analysis showed that forest covered 66\% of the study area in 1991, and by 2017 it had decreased to 45.8\%. Most households depend on wood from customary land forests for tobacco curing (69\%) and brick burning (68\%). Furthermore, 47.6\% of the households have expanded their agriculture land by approximately 0.57 hectares during the past 15 years. The interview survey and the focus group discussion identified that the underlying driving factors towards these anthropogenic activities are: (a) population growth, (b) poverty, (c) expensive alternative building materials, (d) lack of awareness, (e) lack of resources, (f) lack of commitment from the tobacco companies, and (g) market system of the cash crops grown in the area. In conclusion, a set of economic, institutional, social, and demographic factors, which are associated with imbalanced relationship between rural and urban areas, underpin agriculture expansion, tobacco growing, and brick burning, and have thereby contributed to the decline of the forest cover in Mwazisi, Malawi.},

The interview survey and the focus group discussion identified that the underlying driving factors towards these anthropogenic activities are: (a) population growth, (b) poverty, (c) expensive alternative building materials, (d) lack of awareness, (e) lack of resources, (f) lack of commitment from the tobacco companies, and (g) market system of the cash crops grown in the area. In conclusion, a set of economic, institutional, social, and demographic factors, which are associated with imbalanced relationship between rural and urban areas, underpin agriculture expansion, tobacco growing, and brick burning, and have thereby contributed to the decline of the forest cover in Mwazisi, Malawi.},

  abstract = {This article surveys the politics of plastics through a reading and analysis of more than 180 scientific articles in the fields of environmental science and environmental studies. Despite the many benefits of plastics, the global plastic system is increasingly being recognized as the source of severe environmental problems. Rather than orient the investigation around specific venues, levels, or architectures of governance, our survey first follows plastic through its life cycle, and then considers the major categories of plastic objects addressed in the current literature, and the different approaches taken to each category. The politics of plastics is a growing field of inquiry, with the most rapid expansion in the areas of marine pollution and microplastics. Our consideration of plastic flows reveals increasing politicization towards the latter end of the life cycle, that is, plastic as waste and pollution. Turning to plastic objects, we observe different forms of mobilization, and varying connections between flows and objects, which allow for multiple interpretations of what is at stake. In the closing section, we consider two recent trends in the plastic governance discussion that take a more holistic view of the plastic crisis: attempts to construct (a) a circular plastics economy and (b) global plastics conventions or treaties. We end the paper by highlighting the need for studies to further investigate the norms and practices that maintain the role of plastics in society, as well as the political and economic arrangements that secure its overabundance and low price.

  abstract = {Today environmental degradation is perceived to be a global phenomena, since the Earth Summit of 1992 gained phenomenal interest among the international community. Consequently there was a major interest among conservationist, environmentalist and other disciplines to write about the alarming rate at which natural resources are being polluted and over utilized and eventually depleted. This is evident when one looks at land, air, water pollution, and deforestation and soil erosion. Human dependence on these resources, most of which are non-renewable, compounded by growth in popUlation numbers will inevitably impact the quality oflife of the global community. Most developing Urban areas in South Africa and formal residential areas where waste removal services are supposed to be available, are characterised by solid waste being illegal dumps on open spaces, streets etc. The heaps of waste have become breeding grounds for insects and pests. The odour emanating from these sites together with potential for diseases can have serious implications on the health of residents as well as aesthetic nature of the environment. It is not yet understood why such situations exists within formal serviced areas. This provided the motivation for the investigation. The purpose of the study was to investigate solid waste management practices in a forn1al residential area of Durban namely Umlazi and its negative impact on the human and natural environments. The effect of the social dimensions of households on solid waste practices was investigated in order to examine relationship between socio economic and current waste practices. Current perceptions, attitudes and solid waste practices of households were assessed to explain the influence of socio economIC factors in the planning and operations of solid waste management systems in townships. Questionnaires relating to the problem were administered to the residents ofUmlazi. The results indicated that the waste collection system is characterised by inefficiency. The study revealed that attitudes and perceptions, educational status and income are significant factors that contribute to effective waste management processes. The analysis of data for domestic solid waste showed that the evaluation of both the social demographic and solid waste generation rates is crucial in understanding why such inefficiency in formally serviced areas exists. This in turn could provide guidelines on the possible roles that households can play in the planning and implementation of domestic solid waste. Amongst others the consumption patterns, knowledge about waste management practices and preferences for service provision were interpreted. Based on the findings of this study and the review of related literature, it is concluded that attitudes and perceptions of residents need to change. Residents need to become responsible for caring for their environment and a different mind set towards solid waste is needed. Appropriate policy backed by legislation and enforceable regulations must underpin the strategic alternatives selected to deal with waste management in the purban Metropolitan Area (DMA). Policy legislation and regulations at the local level must be fitting with those set at national and provincial levels of government. The planning of integrated waste management should be a consultative process in which partnerships are encouraged between the DMA authorities and communities who will benefit from the waste management plan. The public and private organisations that handle waste in the municipality should be seen as part of the solution, not a problem, of waste management. Effective waste management should be appreciated as a public good from which benefits such as opportunities for employment, resource recovery, safe disposal of hazardous waste, reduced pollution and community development projects can spring.},

This paper investigated the behavior of consumers in Nigeria towards this waste stream and their willingness to participate in waste mobile phones recycling. This study also assessed the willingness of consumer's to pay for a more `environment friendlier' phone \textendash{} the so-called `green phone'. We performed a principal component analysis with varimax rotation in order to condense some of our questions into a smaller set of factors. We developed a model to estimate and explain the willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for `green' cell phones. The model showed that the significant predictors of willingness to pay extra for green electronics include awareness and concern about the deteriorating environment, age, and the general attitude towards the environment. About 65\% of the respondents are either `willing' or `very willing' to drop-off no-longer-in-use electronics at a nearby recycling facility. Majority of the respondents are also very willing to pay a premium for a green phone. Considering the increasing waste generation by this sector, it has become expedient that a recycling program be introduced for these potentially harmful waste materials.},

  abstract = {The world is currently undergoing a paradigm shift towards a circular society in which resources are recovered and reused rather than discarded. The global population has surpassed seven billion people, and rapid urbanisation in many areas is putting a significant strain on our ability to provide basic services to all. The Sustainable Development Goals highlight the fact that millions still lack access to food, healthcare, water and sanitation. At the same time, it is increasingly evident that we are consuming the Earth's resources and releasing waste into the environment in an unsustainable manner. The resulting effects on climate change, biodiversity loss and changing nutrient cycles threaten to over-step critical planetary boundaries. Crossing these boundaries has the potential to cause irreversible environmental change and to threaten the ability of humanity to develop and thrive. Sanitation systems manage carbon, nutrient and water flows, which are key resource flows that affect the planetary boundaries and thus should be recovered and recirculated instead of being released into the environment. Increasing resource recovery within our sanitation systems can play a critical role in shifting to a more sustainable society. There are significant resources within excreta and wastewater fractions that can be recovered and turned into useful products. For example, the average person excretes 4.5 kg of nitrogen, 0.5 kg of phosphorus and 1.2 kg of potassium every year. These elements and other micronutrients found in excreta are critical for the fertilising and restoration of agricultural soils. The energy value of faeces is on average 4 115 kcal/kg of dry solids. This energy can be utilised as a renewable energy source. On top of this, there are large volumes of wastewater that can be captured, cleaned and reused. However, human excreta and wastewater contain pathogens and other undesired substances, risks that need to be managed in a reuse system. The growing demand for recycling needs to be complemented with a growing knowledge of how to do it safely. The aim of this document is to provide an overview of the possibilities for resource recovery from sanitation and provide guidance on treatment processes to achieve safe products for reuse. The focus of this document is on resource recovery from the organic wastes managed in sanitation systems and, to a lesser extent, on the recovery of water and energy generation. Resource recovery sanitation systems are defined as systems that safely recycle excreta and organic waste while minimising the use of non-renewable resources such as water and chemicals. Safe recycling means that waste flows are managed so that physical, microbial and chemical risks are minimised. Thus, the recycled product should not pose any significant health threat or environmental impact when correctly used.},

Kaolinite (K) and quartz (Q)-rich earthen materials were mixed with the CCR and used to mould CEBs at optimum moisture content (OMC) and OMC+2 \% of the dry mixtures, cured at 20 \textdegree C, ambient temperature in the lab (30+5\textdegree C) and 40 \textdegree C for 0-90 days. After curing, the reactivity of the materials and compressive strength of dry CEBs were tested. Increasing the moulding moisture from OMC to OMC+2 decreased the compressive strength 0.3 times (4.4 to 3.3 MPa) for the CEBs stabilized with 20 \% CCR cured at 30+5 \textdegree C for 45 days. Similarly, the compressive strength (4.4 MPa) was reached by CEBs stabilized with 10 and 20 \% CCR after 28 and 45 days of curing, respectively. At 40 \textdegree C, the compressive strength increased 3.3 times (1.1 to 4.7 MP a with 0 to 20\% CCR) for K-rich and 2.5 times (2 to 7.1 MPa) for Q-rich materials. At 20 \textdegree C, the compressive strength increased only 1.3 times (1.1 to 2.5 MPa) for K-rich and barely 0.7 times (2 to 3.4 MPa) for Q-rich materials. These suggest that CCR is useful for stabilization and improving the performances of CEBs in hot regions.},

  note = {\subsection{\textbf{11 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BEST PRACTICE IN FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Provide a clear rationale for the choice of focus group discussion: The researcher must be able to provide adequate justification for the choice of focus group discussion technique as the ``best suited to answering their questions about a phenomenon'' (Berry \& Kincheloe,~\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-bib-0008}{2004}, p. 4). A clear rationale should provide the readers with confidence that the selection of data sources, the analysis and the interpretation is reliable and valid and that the quality of research is not compromised (Wilson,~\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-bib-0088}{2009}, p. 81).

\item 

\par
Focus on facilitator skills: Focus group discussion relies on facilitators or moderators to guide the group's discussion (Berg,~\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-bib-0006}{1989}; Morgan,~\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-bib-0059}{1996}). According to Morgan et~al. (\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-bib-0061}{1998}) and Litosseliti (\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-bib-0048}{2004}), the facilitator must have a set of skills and techniques to ensure that the issues under discussion are addressed comprehensively. Here is a suggested skill set:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
aAbility to build rapport by creating a warm, supportive and comfortable environment to foster open and honest dialogue among diverse groups and individuals.

\item 
bHave good and active listening skills to help engage with the respondent by paraphrasing or summarising their responses and using gestures to encourage conversation.

\item 
cHave good observation skills, pay attention to participants' body language or demeanour and recognise group dynamics.

\item 
dHave good speaking, communication skills and knowledge of the topic of discussion including some basic information on the subject to help in probing different answers for more in-depth discussion but should demonstrate some degree of ``na\"ivet\'e'' to encourage participants' responses.

\item 
eFlexibility to adapt to the flow of the discussion, remain open to changes in the discussion guide, adjust to participants' requests during the group and adjust physical behaviours and activity around the room.

\item 
fAbility to remain impartial by getting involved while maintaining verbal and non-verbal objectivity.

\item 
gShould have a sense of humour to keep the discussion relaxed, encourage sharing of information and maintain a human connection.

\end{itemize}

\item 
Report methods and results based on Figure~\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-fig-0001}{1}: The review revealed that a major lacuna of most of the studies was improper reporting or inadequate reporting of key attributes of the application of the technique. We, therefore, recommend that future studies should explicitly mention the methodological decisions based on the guidelines provided in the flow chart (Figure~\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-fig-0001}{1}).

\item 
Beware of biases affecting group discussions: Unlike interviews or Q methodology which are individually administered, focus group discussion is a group-based technique. It is subject to the biases which are commonly encountered in any group setting. These include dominance effect (a dominant individual shapes the discussion), halo effect (the perceived status of a group member influences the discussion), groupthink (the members in a group tend to think similarly to maintain group cohesion) among several others (Mukherjee et~al.,~\href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12860#mee312860-bib-0063}{2015}). The facilitator (and/or assistant) should keep a keen eye out to spot and address such biases in the data collection phase.

\item 
Ensure a clear pathway between the data obtained, coding and subsequent analysis of data: The review revealed that 144 out of 170 studies used focus group discussion alongside other techniques in the same study. In most of these studies, it was extremely difficult to tease out what component of the results and inferences were derived from the focus group discussion alone. Providing this information might enable the reader to make a clear connection between the research question asked, results obtained and subsequent analysis.

In cities of the developing world, the informal sector plays an important role in the management of solid waste. This paper examines the position of the informal recycling sector in the planning and reform of solid waste management in the city of Enugu, Nigeria. The paper is based on direct field observations, key-informant interviews with important stakeholders in solid waste management in Enugu, and review of relevant legislation, policy documents and reports on solid waste management. The paper highlights recent efforts to visibly improve governance through reform of solid waste management in the urban area. Contribution of informal recyclers towards handling the city's solid waste problem, job creation and poverty alleviation is also noted. The study also reveals that the import of the informal recycling sector has not been given adequate consideration within the framework of the reforms in solid waste management. With the focus of the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, improvement of quality of life and environmental sustainability, this paper observes that the informal recycling sector in Enugu possesses unacknowledged development potential. The paper calls for official recognition and support of the activity and empowerment of people involved in it within the context of this reform programme.},

However the fuel efficiency of improved cook stoves has undergone limited in-field evaluation. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of rocket mud stoves (RMS) in reducing fuelwood use in a rural community in Kenya. Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal (before\textendash after) study designs, we conducted two-day kitchen performance tests in 145 households and 37 households, respectively. Fuel consumption was 5.4~kg~d-1 in the rocket stove group and 6.7~kg~d-1 in the three-stone stoves group. After we accounted for number of people cooked for, cooking duration and fuel moisture, RMS use was associated with 1.6~kg~d-1 (95\% CI: 0.6, 2.7) lower fuel use relative to three-stone stoves in the cross-sectional sample, and 2.2~kg~d-1 (95\% CI: 1.0, 3.3) lower fuel use in the longitudinal sample. Our data suggest that simple wood stoves like rocket mud stoves could ease the burden of fuelwood collection for rural households, and potentially address social and local environmental consequences of fuelwood collection.},

The purpose of this paper is to map out how and to what extent occupational, political-legal, economic and social dynamics are experienced differently by gender in a highly vulnerable segment of the urban informal economy, and explore gender differences in these workers' coping strategies and the levels of action they develop to protect their livelihoods. Design/methodology/approach The analysis is based on a mixed methods study which combined a quantitative survey of informal workers with a qualitative participatory methodology. Study participants were drawn from a purposive sample of informal workers who belong to, or are affiliated with, membership-based workers' organisations. The sample consists of waste pickers (n=614) from Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Bogot\'a, Colombia; Durban, South Africa; and Nakuru, Kenya. Findings The data show that despite significant differences between women and men upon entry into (informal) employment, their perceptions of key drivers and impacts are largely similar, with the exception of concerns around various types of physical security among women. They also indicate that levels of action among men and women waste pickers are only moderately influenced by gender, but are strongly influenced by the degree of organisation in the sector and the symbolic assets held by workers. The findings also illustrate the way in which gendered power dynamics operate within the informal recycling sector and how different levels of sector organisation and development often contribute to opportunities for collective action and, in turn, a reduction in gendered vulnerabilities. Originality/value The study offers a new policy angle which connects the level of sector organisation and development with the levels of action taken by informal workers in adapting to different types of shocks, as well as what this means in terms of gender empowerment.}

Study design Literature review. Methods A literature review was undertaken to evaluate the informal waste management system and formal waste management system in Nigeria and other developing countries with similar settings. Nine databases were searched and 34 studies met the following inclusion criteria: evaluation of the role of informal waste collectors, recycling and solid waste management in developing countries. Results Most of the evaluated studies (97\%, n~=~33) acknowledged the significant environmental and socio-economic roles played by the informal waste collectors and scavengers in developing countries. The studies identified the following as barriers to inclusive waste management in Nigeria: repressive policy, unhygienic waste collection methods, lack of evidence to support activity, and low quality and quantity of secondary materials. Conclusions Scavengers and other groups of informal recyclers see waste as a source of income and livelihood, whilst the general public see it as an aesthetic problem and see the people engaged in resource recovery as a social nuisance. Integrating their informal services with the formal waste management system is a potential tool to empower these people to increase their skills in resource recovery and improve their working and living conditions. Inclusive waste management is a process, and observable changes are taking place in some developing countries where waste pickers and informal waste collectors have become environmental agents. A major limitation to the integration of informal waste collectors and scavengers is the social acceptance of their activity as a viable source of income, and of themselves as environmental agents in the sustainability of virgin resources.},

Adopting a three-dimensional approach to precarity that centres on 'exposure to danger', 'uncertain tenure' and 'dependence', this paper compares Uruguayan waste-pickers' (clasificadores) experiences of precarity at the Felipe Cardoso landfill, its related cooperative, and a formal sector recycling plant. Clasificadores at Felipe Cardoso characterise the landfill as a 'mother' who dependably provides them with food, clothes and construction materials. Recently, the Uruguayan state has sought to divert clasificadores to what is regarded as more dignified labour in recycling plants. I argue that the formalisation of some waste-pickers creates a cleavage within the occupation, dispossessing and delegitimising those who continue to work 'informally'.}

It goes beyond the informal/formal binary, instead proposing the concepts of ?para-formality? to describe economic activity that exists in parallel to regulated and taxed spheres, and ?quasi-formality? to describe processes of formalisation that are supported by underlying informal practices. When unregulated, clasificadores enjoyed parallel services in health, finance and social security, implying that benefits of ?formalisation? must be explored ethnographically rather than assumed. The persistence of ?quasi-formal? activity within formalised recycling plants complicates simple narratives of informal to formal transitions and suggests that the concept can be useful for the study of labour policies in Latin America and beyond.},

  abstract = {This study estimates the contribution from the open burning of municipal wastes in some of Nigeria's major cities to atmospheric levels of air pollutants. Information obtained on open burning emission factors and municipal solid waste (MSW) generation estimates was combined to estimate annual levels of the pollutants from the open burning of MSW. Per capita distributions of pollutants were calculated on the basis of cities' populations. The estimates of inorganic emissions across the cities studied were from 913.73 to 81,600 tons per year (TPY) of particulate matter; 4,797 to 428,400 TPY of oxides of nitrogen; 342.65 to 30,600; and 57 to 5,100 TPY of sulfur dioxide, while the estimates for methane ranged from 742 to 66,300 TPY and for other nonmethane organic compounds ranged from 1,713 to 153,000 TPY. Given the composition of MSW in these cities, the nonmethane organic compounds are likely to be composed of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds. Given the wide varieties of both inorganic and organic air pollutants released during the open burning of MSW and the associated human health and environmental impacts, it is high time that stakeholders at all levels of government came up with policies and regulatory measures for the management of MSW in the country.},

This paper presents the findings of a study which assessed the willingness to handle and use urine in agriculture among people living in rural areas of eThekwini Municipality, South Africa. Results show that less than 5\% of participants are using urine as a fertiliser. This could be attributed to limited awareness of the value of urine in agriculture since only 9.7\% are aware that urine contains essential nutrients that can support plant growth. Furthermore, health concerns, smell and the opinions of others are identified as barriers to the handling of urine. The study therefore recommends that participatory field trials and promotional activities are conducted to improve users' awareness and acceptance. The outcome of this research is of importance to help inform low- and middle-income countries' governments as they address urban and environmental challenges such as access to adequate sanitation, poverty and food security.},

  abstract = {Air pollution is prevalent in cities and urban centers in developing countries including sub-Saharan Africa, but ground monitoring data on local pollution remain inadequate, hindering effective mitigation. We employed low-cost sensing and measurement technologies to quantify pollution levels based on particulate matter (PM2.5), NO2, and O3 over a 6 month period for selected urban centers in three of the four macroregions in Uganda. PM2.5 diurnal profiles exhibited consistent patterns across all monitoring locations with higher pollution levels manifesting from 18:00 to 00:00 and from 06:00 to 09:00; while the periods from 00:00 to 05:00 and from 09:00 to 17:00 had the lowest levels. Daily PM2.5 varied widely between 34 and 107 {$\mu$}g/m3 over a 7 day period, well within unhealthy levels (55.5-150.4 {$\mu$}g/m3) for short-term exposure. The inconsistent daily trend are instructive for multiple pollutant assessment to aid specific policy initiatives. The results also show inverse relations between seasonal particulate levels and precipitation, that is, R (correlation coefficient) = -0.93 and -0.62 for Kampala and Wakiso, R = -0.49 and -0.44 for the Eastern region, and R = -0.65 and -0.96 for the Western region. NO2 monthly concentrations replicated PM2.5 spatial levels, whereas O3 exhibited inverse relations probably due to a higher retention time in lessurbanized environments. Both PM2.5 and NO2 correlated positively with the resident population. Our findings show significant spatiotemporal variations and exceedances of health guidelines by about 4-6 times across most study locations (with two exceptions) for longer-term exposure. This paper demonstrably highlights the practicability and potential of low-cost approaches for air quality monitoring, with strong prospects for citizen science. This paper also provides novel information regarding air pollution that is needed to improve control strategies for reducing exposures.},

Modelling may refer to estimating emissions of specific complex source categories, e.g. natural sources or delayed emissions, or to estimation of source strengths by inverse modelling using air concentration measurements and a priori emissions inventories as input. Inventory construction can focus on a specific year or on estimating multi-year historical trends. Many of the natural emissions inventories are thus the result of modelling of the underlying processes using these global datasets. The latter is defined as the total amount of trace gas in the atmosphere and related reservoirs, usually just the troposphere and the stratosphere. The sink strength of long-lived gases can be derived from can be derived from a combination of atmospheric observations, laboratory experiments and models.},

China's inexpensive labour and manufacturing abilities have already made it ``the world's factory'' and for e-waste recycling it is no exception. Informal workers do the majority of e-waste collection and recycling in cities throughout China. E-waste recycling work provides livelihoods for migrant workers and the urban poor and has formed a well-established shadow economy. The improper dismantling and burning of e-waste for resource recovery exposes workers to toxins and heavy metals, and causes severe air, water, and soil contamination. The illegal global trade of e-waste makes it a transboundary environmental governance problem of local and global scales. This paper investigates informal workers' knowledge of the environmental impacts of e-waste, perceptions of their work and whether they would be receptive to government regulation of recycling work. It finds that informal recyclers interviewed lack environmental awareness of the dangers related to e-waste recycling and are unwilling to be regulated due to fear of losing jobs and profits through regulation. Weak e-waste legislation and social marginalization are also major barriers to protecting e-waste recyclers and the environment. Through a scalar analysis of environmental governance, this paper proposes strengthening the roles of small enterprises and inclusion of Non Governmental Organization (NGOs) and Government Organized NGOS (GONGOs) to work in the informal sector to find safer recycling solutions to fill the large gap between legislation and de facto practices.},

This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject.

This increased attention has been due to the continuous insanitary and health threatening conditions, in spite of governments' huge budgetary interventions. Meanwhile, for most urban poor, waste collection and recycling is a common means for eking out a living, yet this potential for improving solid waste management appears untapped by the authorities. Using mainly qualitative research techniques, this study examines the role of the informal sector and promotes dialogue on the potential of this sector in solid waste management. The findings show that the practice has become a survival strategy for thousands among the urban poor and that, the proper integration of the sector into the existing solid waste management policies can lead to sustainable management practices and possibly help alleviate poverty.},

  abstract = {The informal sector in developing countries plays a particularly important role in the overall economic development, yet due to epistemological neglect, its conceptualization focuses on the prism of poverty and social exclusion, hence overshadowing its embedded innovativeness, adaptability and contributions to job creation, poverty alleviation and environmental management. This paper contributes in bridging this knowledge dearth by focusing on how informal e-waste recyclers negotiate the challenges of contemporary political economy contexts. Using an urban mining lens, this paper shows how crucial this sector is for the success of any municipal waste management system and Accra's local economy in general. It is contended that the continuous denial of the sector's virtues in the economy is a poor situational analysis and the research emphasizes instead the need to consider as well as harness the sector's potential in order to create not only employment for the poor but also to bring e-waste recycling into mainstream waste management scholarship.},

Prior studies have attribute varied reasons for this development including the quest for greener pastures and unequal development in northern Ghana. What has escaped critical scrutiny is some migrants? ability to escape extreme rural poverty, albeit in harsh urban environment. Such a missing gap can potentiate high policy failures, hence the need for academic attention. Using a mixed method, we focus on two informal daily livelihoods as exemplars ? exceptionalism ? in Accra. We see their embedded organisational vitality and dynamic networks as illuminating for good livelihood practices, proper city governance and fostering economic empowerment. We call on city authorities to take cognisance of such complexities and heterogeneity of production?labour relations, failure of which can spell doom for policies ostensibly initiated to curb migration, as they are likely to be underpinned by factual inaccuracies and may result in ill-fated interventions.},

With a shift in thinking from nutrient removal to nutrient recovery, new public-private partnerships are developing to capture nutrients from the waste streams for reuse in agriculture. The prospects for cost recovery from capturing phosphorous are significant, if savings in wastewater treatment and sludge disposal costs are considered, as so far the phosphate recovery costs still result in prices higher than those of phosphate rock, unless niche markets are targeted. The chapter differentiates between nutrient recovery options commonly seen in sewered and non-sewered (on-site) sanitation systems, looking at wastewater, fecal sludge, biosolids and urine. To date, nutrient recovery from wastewater is driven more by the treatment sector and its challenges or by changing regulations, rather than by market demand for alternative fertilizers.},

However, to date, there has been no study critically examining the utility of the methodological approaches used to evaluate CTs. This article reviews the approaches used to evaluate CTs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to provide recommendations for improving future CTs evaluations. We conducted searches for CTs evaluation studies in SSA in the peer-reviewed and grey literature using electronic databases, hand searching of selected journals, organisational websites, Google Scholar and Scirus Internet search engines. The review included 53 evaluation studies which were largely outcome-focused evaluations (95\%; n\,=\,50). The studies were undertaken within 24 CT programs comprising 11 unconditional CTs (UCTs), eight conditional CTs (CCTs) and five combined UCTs and CCTs. The review finds that while there is evidence of CTs impacts on a broad range of outcomes, the current evaluation approaches have primarily been experimental designs and have largely failed to provide explanations for mechanisms of change. To improve CTs policy and practice, there is the need to consider theory-based evaluation approaches such as realist evaluation that provide insights about the contexts and mechanisms through which programs generate outcomes in different circumstances.},

The findings show that various digital innovations are being applied by entrepreneurs including web-based solutions, mobile apps and 3D printing. The case studies also show that multinational companies, especially consumer facing brands, are major players in the national plastic value chains in African countries, acting as seed funders for start-ups as well as buyers of recycled plastics. Current initiatives that are underway are positive signs that changes are in progress to address the environmental and social impacts of plastics value chains in Africa. However, to achieve a transition to sustainable circular value chains, changes at policy level will be required to enable scaling-up of local start-up businesses, address regulatory barriers to digital solutions, create markets for recycled plastic materials and implement extended producer responsibility regulations.},

Recycling technologies should therefore efficiently remove contaminants of concern. Scope and approach Usually, the abundant data available for recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are extrapolated to polyolefins. This paper reviews the differences of basic properties and typical contaminants of polyolefins compared to PET. The use of thermal desorption process to remove polyolefin contaminants is discussed. Key findings and conclusions It is suggested in this review that this extrapolation is not scientifically justified, on the basis of the comparison between the intrinsic diffusion properties of contaminants of concern in PET and in polyolefins. It is concluded that the scope of contaminants of concern considered for the safety assessment of polyolefins recycling technologies based on thermal desorption should be carefully re-examined.},

One challenge of decentralized wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS) is handling and utilization of the generated sludge. Sludge drying reed beds (SDRBs) are a robust method for dewatering and stabilization of sludge. Constructed wetlands (CWs) and SDRBs can be integrated to treat both wastewater and sludge. SDRBs require more area than most other sludge treatment options, but have low operational cost and energy requirements. The land area required for SDRB's can be optimized by the selection of an appropriate loading rate, sludge application frequency and resting phase. This paper gives a review regarding the use of SDRB's as well as presenting a pilot scale experiment comparing planted and unplanted sludge drying beds in Kathmandu. The planted beds showed a higher dewatering capability and higher reduction of volatile solids (VS). A short-term pilot-scale experiment can give valuable input to the design and operation of full-scale systems and for sub-tropical climate as that of Kathmandu Nepal, an initial sludge loading rate (SLR) of 100 kg total solids (TS)/m2/year is suggested with a gradual increase to up to 250 kg TS/m2/year.},

The obtained results would be used to assess the amount of air pollution emitted from household solid waste open burning. A survey was employed, through the use of questionnaires, to collect data from a random sample of 4300 households residing in areas governed by 96 LAOs. According to the results, it was evident that a total of 26.17 Mt of solid waste were generated per year, of which 6.39 Mt/year was not collected by the LAOs and was eliminated by households. Moreover, the percentage of waste burned on or outside the households' property was 53.7\%, or an equivalent of 3.43 Mt/year of solid waste burned in open areas. In addition, it was found that 0.66 Mt/year of solid waste collected by the LAOs was burned in open areas and was not eliminated properly. Hence, the total amount of solid waste from these two sources was 4.09 Mt/year, which resulted in the emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, and particulate matter of 1247.3 kt/year, 103.0 kt/year, 1.2 kt/year, 7.4 kt/year, and 19.6 kt/year, respectively.},

  abstract = {The current plastic industry is associated with climate change, fossil fuel depletion and littering of plastic waste. To reduce these environmental impacts, companies and governmental bodies are increasingly adopting strategies based on the concept Circular Economy. However, circular decision-making is usually based on analyses that do not provide enough insights in every sustainability dimension, risking burden-shifting. In this study, environmental, economic and social life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques have been integrated into an overarching sustainability life cycle assessment (LCSA) to assess the impact of recycling High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) non-beverage bottles. The study assesses the impact in 11 environmental categories, the life cycle costs, and the social risks associated with the related economic sectors. An ad-hoc system expansion approach was developed to overcome the multifunctionality issue so commonly challenging in circular systems. The results indicate that using recycled HDPE leads to significant reductions in all the considered environmental categories. The economic analysis indicated that the material cost of recycled HDPE is slightly lower than for virgin HDPE, but the manufacturing costs are higher and highly dependent on the specific value chain. The social risks of recycling were found to be higher than for virgin plastic production, and mainly occurring outside the country where the recycling takes place (The Netherlands). Nevertheless, this analysis presents high uncertainty due to the heterogeneity in the recycling sector of the database. This study shows how the LCSA approach can be used to assess and compare the impacts and benefits of circular strategies and calls for further efforts to develop higher disaggregated social risk databases.},

I document government attempts to re-represent the city as a modern, hygienic centre that is receptive to investment and tourism, drawing on discursive framings of public space that seek to redefine legitimate users and uses of the city. Such framings are exclusionary of cartoneros and other marginalized urbanites. As with most forms of actually existing neoliberalism, this regime is contradictory and unstable, both containing and provoking challenges to its coherence. This case study of ?actually existing neoliberalism? in Buenos Aires encourages analytical focus on moments of shift and renewal in urban processes of neoliberalization. In this case the shift marked by the introduction of the regime of public space reveals the priorities and agendas of urban elites as championed by municipal governments, makes visible the paradoxes and contradictions inherent to neoliberal urbanisms, and also exposes openings for resistance, opposition, and renegotiation of urban neoliberal agendas (including protest, discursive reframings of the city and its uses, and the forging of indeterminate alliances).},

The Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighbourhood of Vancouver, BC is undergoing a period of intense redevelopment, raising concerns about the potential displacement of its predominantly low-income residents. In this study, informal recyclers (people who earn income from collecting recyclable or resaleable items) share their observations of neighbourhood change based on their lives and work in the DTES. Informal recyclers? observations reveal that diverse gentrifying processes are at play in the DTES, including restricted access to space, the social exclusion of othered bodies, and the symbolic construction of the DTES as a place of poverty that is in need of intervention. The inclusion of informal recyclers? perspectives provides nuance to place-based processes of gentrification, and acknowledges the concerns of low-income urbanites most affected by urban change.},

  abstract = {The urban population will rise to 6.7 billion by 2050. The United Nations has committed to provide everyone with safely managed sanitation, but there is limited understanding of the scale of the challenge. This paper describes a methodology for rapid assessment of sanitation in cities including a graphical representation (a shit-flow diagram or SFD) and reports on findings from implementation in 39 cities. The SFD provides high level information for planning purposes covering the entire sanitation system in a city. More than half of the human excreta produced in these cities is not safely managed. The most significant portions of the unsafely managed excreta are: (i) contents of pits and tanks which are not emptied and are overflowing, leaking, or discharging to the surrounding environment (14\%); (ii) contents of pits and tanks which are emptied but not delivered to treatment (18\%); (iii) fecal sludge and supernatant delivered to treatment but not treated (3\%); (iv) wastewater in sewers not delivered to treatment (14\%); and (v) wastewater delivered to treatment but not treated (6\%). Many cities currently relying on onsite sanitation for safe storage, particularly in Africa, will need new strategies as populations grow. Containment systems that discharge to open drains are common in some Asian cities; these pose a public health risk. Dumping of excreta is widespread and there is a lack of realistic performance data on which estimates of the extent and effectiveness of treatment can be made. The SFD production process can be challenging due to a lack of data and low technical capacity in cities. There is often uncertainty over terminology and over the status of infrastructure. Formalizing definitions for the SFD preparation process was found to be useful in overcoming capacity constraints in cities. The SFD produces a credible snapshot of the sanitation situation in a city. The paper provides evidence of the urgent need for improved management and monitoring of urban sanitation in cities around the world and highlights the role of the SFD as a planning tool.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing technology have spurred two extraordinary phenomena in science: large-scale and high-throughput data collection coupled with the creation and implementation of complex statistical algorithms for data analysis. These two phenomena have brought about tremendous advances in scientific discovery but have raised two serious concerns. The complexity of modern data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility of the analyses, meaning the ability of independent analysts to recreate the results claimed by the original authors using the original data and analysis techniques. Reproducibility is typically thwarted by a lack of availability of the original data and computer code. A more general concern is the replicability of scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which scientific claims are confirmed by completely independent investigations. Although reproducibility and replicability are related, they focus on different aspects of scientific progress. In this review, we discuss the origins of reproducible research, characterize the current status of reproducibility in public health research, and connect reproducibility to current concerns about the replicability of scientific findings. Finally, we describe a path forward for improving both the reproducibility and replicability of public health research in the future.},

This article explores my use of situated ethics in interactions with street ?waste pickers? during fieldwork in Cape Town using participant observation. I opted to wear a hidden recorder and obtain selective consent, which I argue was more appropriate than relying solely on a fieldnote journal or obtaining signatures on a written consent form. These methods enabled me to communicate respect and build trust. The implication is that a contextualised approach to ethical procedures can be better suited to sensitive research topics, with marginalised social groups, where there is extreme inequality between researchers and their research participants.},

  abstract = {Payment for environmental service contracts commonly require actions beyond adoption of a practice, such as undergoing specified enrollment procedures, granting consent to being monitored, and paying penalties for violations. These provisions are a bundle of attributes a landholder must accept with contract enrollment, leading to transaction costs in the contracting process. This article develops a principal\textendash agent framework to study the links between these transaction costs and the well-known information asymmetries between the landholders and the government agency offering contracts. Using stated choice data collected from a sample of farmers, we estimate a mixed logit model to quantify the contribution of different contract attributes on contract willingnessto-accept (WTA). More stringent provisions in contracts were found to raise individual WTA by widely differing amounts across farmers, but the average effects imply that overall contract supply is sensitive to stringency. From a series of microsimulations based on the estimated model, we find that transaction costs create a significant drain on the cost-effectiveness of contracting from the agency's point of view, similar in magnitude to the inefficiency created by hidden information. Although stringent contractual terms raise program expenditures, they may be justified if they raise compliance rates enough to offset the added cost. We also simulate an implicit frontier to trace out the change in compliance needed to justify a given increase in stringency. For environmental benefits in the range of previous estimates, this analysis suggests that stringent terms would need to substantially raise compliance rates to be cost effective.},

  abstract = {Sanitation workers provide an essential public service that is key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), but often costs them their dignity and health. Many governments in low- and middle-income countries fail to support their sanitation workforce. This is due, in part, to a lack of knowledge about sanitation workers' needs and the challenges they face. This study aims to address this knowledge gap through four assessments conducted in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia that explored the health and safety, financial security, legal protection, and dignity of sanitation workers. Methodologies included literature reviews, key informant interviews (110), focus group discussions (7), and a survey. The findings suggest that sanitation workers across Africa face serious health and safety risks, heightened by a lack of adequate protective equipment and access to healthcare services. Their pay is insufficient and unstable, and the regulatory environment offers them little legal protection. Many also face stigma and discrimination. These challenges were found to be more acute for manual emptiers and those working informally. The study concludes that governments must develop context-specific action plans to support their sanitation workforce, guided by the results of national and sub-national assessments and in collaboration with sanitation worker groups.},

The study sampled 110 households in specific areas with different population density and household scale. Household solid waste was classified into 13 main categories and 25 sub-categories. The results showed that average generation rate of waste in Hanoi City is 0.63 kg per person per day with a slightly higher rate in rural areas than urban ones. The largest proportion was food and garden waste at 78.9\% followed by plastic and paper. Plastic waste was segregated into plastic and nylon, and nylon was double that of plastics in household solid waste. Compared to previous studies, this study found a higher portion of organic matter in the waste characterization that could be attributed to the changes in lifestyle patterns associated with COVID-19. This situation provides challenges and opportunities for introducing biomass technology to recover energy.},

Specifically, for PET bottles, a high content of recycled material (rPET) is demanded by the industry and consumers. This study was carried out in a lab environment replicating real-life industrial processes, to investigate the possible impacts on rPET quality over eleven recycling loops, aiming to use high amounts of rPET repetitively. A cycle included extrusion, solid state polycondensation (SSP), a second extrusion to simulate bottle production, hot wash and a drying step. 75\% rPET and 25\% virgin PET were extruded in eleven cycles to simulate a recycling and production process. Samples underwent chemical, physical and biological analysis. The quality of the rPET material was not adversely affected. Parameters such as coloring, intrinsic viscosity, concentration of critical chemicals and presence of mutagenic contaminants could be positively assessed. The quality of the produced material was likely influenced by the input material's high standard. A closed loop PET bottle recycling process using an rPET content of up to 75\% was possible when following the proposed process, indicating that this level of recycled content can be maintained indefinitely without compromising quality.},

With few air quality monitoring systems available, this study provides much needed high temporal resolution data to investigate the concentrations of particulate matter (PM) air pollution in Kenya. Calibrated low-cost optical particle counters (OPCs) were deployed in Kenya in three locations: two in the capital Nairobi and one in a rural location in the outskirts of Nanyuki, which is upwind of Nairobi. The two Nairobi sites consist of an urban background site and a roadside site. The instruments were composed of an AlphaSense OPC-N2 ran with a Raspberry Pi low-cost microcomputer, packaged in a weather-proof box. Measurements were conducted over a 2-month period (February\textendash March 2017) with an intensive study period when all measurements were active at all sites lasting 2 weeks. When collocated, the three OPCN2 instruments demonstrated good inter-instrument precision with a coefficient of variance of 8.8 {$\pm$} 2.0 \% in the fine particle fraction (PM2.5). The low-cost sensors had an absolute PM mass concentration calibration using a collocated gravimetric measurement at the urban background site in Nairobi.},

Here we show how such sensors, deployed as a network, provide unprecedented insights into the patterns of pollutant emissions, in this case at London Heathrow Airport (LHR). Measurements from the sensor network were used to unequivocally distinguish airport emissions from long range transport, and then to infer emission indices from the various airport activities. These were used to constrain an air quality model (ADMS-Airport), creating a powerful predictive tool for modelling pollutant concentrations. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the results show that the nonairport component is the dominant fraction ({$\sim$}75\%) of annual NO2 around the airport and that despite a predicted increase in airport related NO2 with an additional runway, improvements in road traffic fleet emissions are likely to more than offset this increase. This work focusses on London Heathrow Airport, but the sensor network approach we demonstrate has general applicability for a wide range of environmental monitoring studies and air pollution interventions.},

\textbf{\textbullet{} }The idea of reverse logistics started back in 1982 but the research gain momentum after 2008 as can be seen from the analysis of~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261833590X#fig4}{Fig.~4}. The globalization of the economy has created an agitation in organizations forcing to adopt changes in operations and in client assistance (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261833590X#bib73}{Vaz et~al., 2013}). The increase in number of publication is about 300\% since 2008. Substantial amount of publishers (62 numbers) and journals (174 numbers) are involved in publishing articles on reverse logistics (activities).
\par
\textbf{\textbullet{} }Before 2005, there were very limited articles in number. Later reverse logistics was given due attention but the research was mainly concentrated in developed countries (United States of America, Spain, Singapore etc.). A significant rise in research from other countries (such as India, China and Iran) was shown after 2013 onwards (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261833590X#tbl7}{Table~7}). Industrial growth in developing countries has risen sharply in the twentieth century. Also, shorter life cycle and technological improvement of products is responsible for enormous waste generation thereby developing a need to study reverse logistics.
\par
Quantitative research methodologies such as~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mathematical-modelling}{mathematical modeling}, simulation and survey methods are the dominant methods in research constituting more than 55\% of the research. Mathematical modeling is the most used research method in the literature. A mathematical model helps industries to optimize their total cost in order to enhance profit (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261833590X#bib5}{Bazen et~al., 2016}). Amongst them many models are focused on network design, facility location and routing. Most of the mathematical and simulation model are verified by numerical examples. A realistic view can be gained if verification to be made through case study approach (Only 17\% of articles on modeling did it) (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261833590X#tbl9}{Table~9}). Also, many models assume that their variables as deterministic for the analysis, but in real they are not. Very few researches are available with~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/stochastic-behavior}{stochastic behavior}~of variables (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261833590X#bib56}{Pokharel and Mutha, 2009}).},

  abstract = {An increase in both consumers' environmental awareness and government regulation related to the environment encourages industries to be more responsible for their products after consumption. As a result, a relatively new concept in logistics called reverse logistics (RL) is introduced. While the forward (or traditional) logistics refers to the process of distributing products from companies (or producers) to consumers, RL refers to the process of moving products from consumers to producers. This practice has attracted not only scholars but also practitioners in the field of supply chain and sustainability. A company could gain benefits from the implementation of RL since it can lead to higher profit. However, some barriers regard its implementation despite the benefits that make the company reluctant to implement it. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the barriers to implementing RL in a bottled drinking water company. Moreover, this study also analyses the interaction among the barriers to looking for the possible ``root barrier''. The interpretative structural modelling and MICMAC analysis were used to accomplish the objective of the study. It is expected that the study could help the management to better formulate policies about the implementation of RL.},

The magnitude of this problem has led to increasing pressure from the public for efficient and practical measures to solve the waste problem. This paper analyses the impact of plastic use and disposal in Ghana. It emphasizes the need for commitment to proper management of the impacts of plastic waste and effective environmental management in the country. Sustainable Solid Waste Management (SSWM) is a critical problem for developing countries with regards to climate change and greenhouse gas emission, and also the general wellbeing of the populace. Key themes of this paper are producer responsibility and management of products at end of life. The paper proposes two theatrical recovery models that can be used to address the issue of sachet waste in Ghana.},

In Ghana, rapid urbanization, lack of funding and economic decline in the 1970s through to the 1980s were cited as possible reasons for the poor sanitation of most towns and cities [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/8/9907/htm#B5-ijerph-12-09907}{5}},\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/8/9907/htm#B6-ijerph-12-09907}{6}}]. However, the recent upsurge in waste disposal problems can be attributed to people's general attitudes and perceptions towards wastes [\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/8/9907/htm#B6-ijerph-12-09907}{6}},\textbf{\href{https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/8/9907/htm#B7-ijerph-12-09907}{7}}]},

  abstract = {Municipal solid waste management is one of the major challenges that cities in developing countries are facing. Although waste collection services are critical to build a smart city, the focus of both scholarship and action/activism has been more on the utilization of waste than on collection. We devised a choice experiment to elicit the preferences of municipal residents with regard to the various attributes of solid waste collection services in the Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal. The study showed that households identify waste collection frequency, timing of door-to-door waste collection services, and cleanliness of the streets as the critical elements of municipal waste collection that affect their welfare and willingness to pay. While almost all households (95\%) were participating in the waste collection service in the study area, more than half (53\%) expressed dissatisfaction with the existing service. Women were the main actors engaged in waste collection and disposal at household level. The results of the choice analysis suggest that households prefer a designated waste collection time with waste collection bins placed at regular intervals on the streets for use by pedestrians who often throw garbage on the streets in the absence of bins. For these improvements, households were willing to pay an additional service fee of 10\&ndash;28\% on top of what they were already paying. The study also finds that municipal waste collection can be improved through the involvement of Tole Lane Committees in designing the timing and frequency of the service and by introducing a system of progressive tariffs based on the number of storeys per house.},

Carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrous oxide (NOx), and total particulate matter (TPM) were directly analyzed through a simulation of waste combustion. The potential emissions from other pollutants were predicted by multiplying the weight of the burned waste by the emission factors available in the literature. The estimated waste burned in Semarang City in 2020\textendash 2021 was 58.8~Gg/year, or approximately 9.70\% of the total waste generated in Semarang City. This estimation exceeds local government estimates of 2020 by two-fold. Peri-urban areas (both inner and outer) were identified as the most significant contributors to waste burning. Further, garden waste was the most burned waste (73.61\%), followed by plastic waste (17.45\%). Other wastes, including paper, leather, textile, rubber, and food, were also burned. Overall, a decrease in the activity of waste burning is an important step for reducing the potential of air pollution and climate change.},

This study presents a comprehensive review of current research trends, methodological assessments, and factors behind open waste burning practices from published literature. This review used systematic methods such as PRISMA 2020 methodology, a bibliometric approach, and qualitative content analysis to determine and assess 84 articles related to open burning. The results show that environmental risks and emission factors related to open burning incidents at the landfill or residential level are preferable topics that will be rising in the years to come. Coupling methods such as a transect-based approach with a questionnaire survey and mobile-static plume sampling to determine the activities and incidents as baseline data for risk assessment will help researchers gain a robust dataset of open burning emission inventory. In addition, it was found that environmental knowledge and awareness levels influence open burning practices, thereby opening up opportunities for future research.},

Despite a legal ban, MSW-burning is observed ubiquitously in Indian cities with little being known about the factors shaping it. This study seeks to uncover social and infrastructural factors that affect MSW-burning at the neighborhood level. We couple physical assessments of the infrastructure provision and the MSW-burning incidences in three different neighborhoods of varying socio-economic status in Delhi, with an accompanying study of the social actors (interviews of waste handlers and households) to explore the extent to which, and potential reasons why, MSW-burning occurs. The observed differences in MSW-burning incidences range from 130\,km-2\,day-1 in low-income to 30\,km-2\,day-1 in the high-income areas. However, two high-income areas neighborhoods with functional infrastructure service also showed statistical differences in MSW-burning incidences. Our interviews revealed that, while the waste handlers were aware of the health risks associated with MSW-burning, it was not a high priority in the context of the other difficulties they faced. The awareness of the legal ban on MSW-burning was low among both waste handlers and households. In addition to providing infrastructure for waste pickup, informal restrictions from residents and neighborhood associations can play a significant role in restricting MSW-burning at the neighborhood scale. A more efficient management of MSW requires a combined effort that involves interplay of both social and infrastructural systems.},

Growth has generally helped reduce the incidence of absolute poverty, but less so in more unequal countries. High inequality also threatens to stall future progress against poverty by attenuating growth prospects. Perceptions of rising absolute gaps in living standards between the rich and the poor in growing economies are also consistent with the evidence.},

A key task of top management is to diagnose those barriers of reverse logistics that could be crucial to the survival of the organization in the future. Existing models have focused on diagnosing these barriers independently. As a result, we lack a holistic view in understanding the barriers that hinder reverse logistics. This paper utilizes the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodology to understand the mutual influences among the barriers so that those driving barriers, which can aggravate few more barriers and those independent barriers, which are most influenced by driving barriers are identified. By analyzing the barriers using this model, we may extract crucial barriers that hinder the reverse logistics activities. It can be observed that there are some barriers, which have both high driving power and dependency, thus needing more attention. An actual example of a small case automobile company provides some managerial insights into the methodology. Finally, the implications for practice and future research are discussed.},

Diurnal variations of BC have two peak structures one in the morning ({$\sim$}08 IST) in all seasons and second in the evening ({$\sim$}20 IST) only during the pre-monsoon (March\textendash May). Intra-annual variation in BC indicated February and March months as the bio-mass burning with highest BC mass concentration (3000\textendash 5000 ng/m3). About 46\% of air parcel back trajectories found passing across the in-land regions of southern peninsular India brining transported aerosol to the source location during pre-monsoon. The lowest BC ({$\sim$}1500 ng/m3) is noticed during the monsoon months (June\textendash September). The average BC (2200 ng/m3) represents observational site as a typical rural site. The inter-annual variability of BC did not show any significant trend. However, trends in the maximum (March) and minimum (July) BC values show statistically significant decreasing trend suggesting reduction in bio-mass burning sources during March supported by the decrease in the fire counts. Diurnal variation in the absorption angstrom exponent indicates that the morning and evening peaks are contributed by the bio-mass combustion with values above threshold of 1. However, angstrom exponent values are found below 1 during noon time of monsoon season suggesting fossil fuel contribution. Strong coupling is found between aerosol concentration and tropospheric dynamics, meteorology in addition to the sources. The present study is expected to provide valuable input to the modelers and observational physicists as BC is climate sensitive variable.},

  abstract = {In Brazil, municipal solid waste management (MSWM) faces several challenges in its transition from a waste disposal model to another based on selective collection with recycling and reuse. Each municipality has adopted different institutional arrangements to meet the responsibility shared by the State, industries, and consumers to operate public policies in this field. The consequence has been an inefficient recycling rate, high costs, and the exclusion of waste collectors from the official system. Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follows: (i) to submit a sustainable institutional arrangement based on cooperation between agents, with an intensive use of information technology and logistics and (ii) to assess the economic-financial feasibility of the model. The research method was based on a multilevel, interdisciplinary and systemic analytical structure for the study of path-dependent processes, proposed by Hoff (2011), associated to critical moment identification approach from Collier \& Collier (1991). In addition, an economic valuation model based on discounted cash flow was used. The path dependence analysis reveals the following determinants of this situation: recent legislation; the existence of socially excluded collectors; contractual formats in public-private partnerships; and the need to raise citizens' awareness of their co-responsibility regarding environmental education. In this scenario, the alternative found by the actors is a social business that is inclusive for those at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) and decentralised in micro-cooperatives with different forms of relationship with public authorities. Different from what the experiments indicate, the economic and financial viability of the model, in addition to the environmental, social, and legal benefits, are confirmed.},

  abstract = {It is a challenge to reduce the ever-increasing flow of waste. In Norway the systems for recycling of organic waste, paper, glass, metals, etc. differ between municipalities, both with regard to organizational and to technological structures. Our hypothesis is that people's attitudes and behaviour may differ with different systems of waste management. People's behaviour and attitudes regarding (organic) waste recycling were investigated in two municipalities with differing technical and organisational systems. Data came from interviews with municipal employees, questionnaires, focus groups and multi-criteria mapping. People seem to be better informed and more positive about organic waste recycling in one of the municipalities (MH, which has recycling of organic waste) than in the other (MS, which has no such recycling). The two municipalities had similar sets of important criteria for waste management (price, environmental friendliness, easy solutions, information). Many participants stated that they had learned from the group process, though only a few reported changed preferences. The institutional context seems to be important for people's behaviour and attitudes towards waste management. This implies that people's recycling behaviour does not only depend on technical and organisational aspects, but also on institutions. These are important messages for policy makers. On an individual basis, the different systems in the two municipalities seem to affect people's stated attitudes. These differences diminish when they are in a common setting where process and dialogue stimulate new thoughts and encourage people to act more altruistically.},

\par
As our focus is the role of citizenship within a municipality dealing with collective goods we chose focus groups as a relevant forum for the expression of value systems. The aim of having focus group analyses is to identify conceptual similarity and to discern patterns by identifying those opinions, ideas or feelings that are repeated across individuals, even though they may be expressed in different forms (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib10}{Dransfield et~al., 2004}).~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib18}{Jacobs (1997)}~defines a value-articulating institution as being an arena or mechanism through which people can articulate the different values they place on different goods. It follows that the choice of method will influence which values can be expressed, how they can be expressed, and finally what choices are made. We can define the rules concerning the valuing process as dealing, firstly, with~\emph{who}~participates \textendash{} in other words, is it consumers acting in a market or is it citizens processing goods of a collective nature? Secondly~\emph{what type of data}~is to be chosen \textendash{} is it prices or arguments that are relevant? Finally~\emph{what is the procedure}~for handling data \textendash{} is it through a market process or are data traded-off against each other (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib34}{Vatn, 2005})?
\par
\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib23}{Renn et~al. (1995)}~highlight public participation mechanisms as forums for exchange organized for the purpose of facilitating communication between actors. The choice of focus groups for deliberation allows citizens to express their views in their own language and shows the level of emphasis they put on a particular issue. The method was originally used for environmental issues by~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib5}{Burgess and Harrison (1998)}. A focus group is what we may call ``a structured group conversation or discussion'', and it is being used as a communicative process to gain insights into the kind of rationale framing people's attitudes and behaviour, the impact of the groups, and the felt need for finding compromises (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib5}{Burgess and Harrison, 1998},~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib6}{Burgess et~al., 2000}).~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib9}{Davies et~al. (2003)}~report that there is a growing body of shared `good practice' about such processes. These same processes can also be used to benchmark public opinion and underlying values, issues and concerns. In Contingent Valuation studies, focus groups are often used in the explorative phase as a basis for the development of hypotheses and the design of questionnaires (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000479#bib3}{Brouwer et~al., 1999}).},

The purpose of the investigation is to determine the relationship between the formal and informal recycling sectors in Catalonia and determine how each of their activities impacts the other. From the case study in the city of Granollers, it was determined that from the spring of 2018 to the fall of 2019, the informal recyclers had the potential to collect roughly 44\% of the cardboard in their geographical area, helping to meet the environmental goals of the region, but receiving no recognition for their work nor acknowledgement regarding their role in the waste management system. This investigation also analyzed the economic relationship between the formal and informal systems, and the effects that international events, such as China's National Sword policy, had on that relationship. It was determined that the embeddedness of waste systems and global waste markets affect not only the formal system, but their relationship with the informal system as well.},

Here, we present some of the first field data to be reported on the uncontrolled domestic burning of waste. A representative community of Mexico (Huejutla de Reyes Municipality) was investigated and household surveys, interviews with waste operators and a waste characterisation analysis were completed to assess the extent of, and factors controlling, the open burning of waste. Waste collection provision to rural communities was very limited and, consequently 92\% of households in rural areas reported that they disposed of waste by uncontrolled burning in backyards or unofficial dumps. Overall, 24\% of the total MSW generated in the Municipality was disposed by uncontrolled burning. Urban and periurban areas received twice-weekly collections and the rate of uncontrolled burning was considerably smaller compared to rural households, corresponding to approximately 2\% of total waste generation. Carbon equivalency calculations showed that burning waste in backyards represented approximately 6\% of the total and 8.5\% of fuel related CO2Eq emissions by the municipality. Moreover, the equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2Eq) from black carbon (BC) emitted by uncontrolled burning in backyards was over fifteen times larger compared to methane (CH4) potentially released from equivalent amounts of combustible biodegradable waste disposal at the official dumpsite. An assessment of local respiratory health data showed the incidence of disease was higher in rural than in urban areas, when the opposite trend is typically observed in the international literature; given the high rate of burning activity found in rural areas we suggest that open burning of waste could be a major reason for the apparent poorer respiratory health status of the rural population and requires further investigation. The results emphasise the importance of including BC from uncontrolled burning of waste in international emission inventories of greenhouse gases and in the assessment of the health status of local communities in developing countries where this practice is prevalent.},

  abstract = {The present research sought to deepen the debates about how the collector of recyclable material, a subject that has built his political resistance in the Brazilian scenario from the process of re-signification of garbage and his profession. Its empowerment observed from the end of the 20th century was concomitant with the growth of environmental discussions and the strengthening of the solidarity economy as an alternative for economic emancipation in Brazil. In this context, the individual who used to live on the margins of society established himself as a fundamental factor in the recycling chain and became an environmental agent. The question that guided the investigation was "how has the pandemic influenced waste pickers' solidarity organizations, given their challenges and opportunities?". In this context, two specific objectives were determined to be answered in the course of the research. The first sought to understand the relationship between the solidarity economy and the formation of waste picker collectives; the second aimed to identify the challenges and opportunities that could arise from these solidarity organizations' experiences. A vast theoretical analysis was conducted to understand the foundations of the Solidarity Economy, an alternative to the informal economy and a form of economic empowerment especially considered for vulnerable populations, as a way to include them economically. Using the case study of Belo Horizonte, a city with a history of alternative economic expressions and strengthened waste pickers' movements, we approached various actors of the recycling chain through qualitative research, using the in-depth interviews approach. Among other findings, the research noted that one of the greatest challenges of the post-pandemic Solidarity Economy is related to the expansion of the capitalist market to areas traditionally aggregated by the Solidarity Economy, because they were previously considered to be on the ``margins of society''. However, these threats also give room for opportunities, from responses that reinforce the legitimacy of cooperatives and associations, through their contractual adequacy with the City Hall for the payment of the environmental service rendered, disconnected from the number of solid waste collected. We have learned that in the daily struggles and achievements of the waste pickers, challenges and opportunities go hand in hand.},

Waste Management is one of the key problems of modern society due to the ever-expanding volume and complexity of discarded domestic and industrial waste. Society is increasingly aware of the need to establish better practices and safer solutions for waste disposal. This requires further investigation into disposal methods and recycling as well as new technologies to monitor landfills, industrial mining wastes and chemical and nuclear repositories. This creates a need for more research on current disposal methods such as landfills, incineration, chemical and effluent treatment, as well as recycling, clean technologies, waste monitoring, public and corporate awareness and general education. The papers contained in this title form a collective record of scientific information and work on the current situation of waste management amongst professionals, researchers, government departments and local authorities.},

Many packages are still simply containers, but they have properties that have been developed to protect the food. These include barriers to oxygen, moisture, and flavors. Active packaging, or that which plays an active role in food quality, includes some microwave packaging as well as packaging that has absorbers built in to remove oxygen from the atmosphere surrounding the product or to provide antimicrobials to the surface of the food. Packaging has allowed access to many foods year-round that otherwise could not be preserved. It is interesting to note that some packages have actually allowed the creation of new categories in the supermarket. Examples include microwave popcorn and fresh-cut produce, which owe their existence to the unique packaging that has been developed.},

  abstract = {The concept of Circular Economy has made a crucial contribution to establishing a changed perspective on recycling, one in which recycling is no longer regarded as merely a part of waste management, but rather intimately linked with preceding stages of production, such as product design and manufacturing. It has been shown that recycling achievements significantly depend on the inputs into recycling processes where complex products require higher recycling efforts. To promote transparency with regard to both product design and its impacts on recycling, the assessment of product recyclability is highly relevant. Current recyclability assessment methods neglect to assess product recyclability from the design perspective or are based on parameters that limit comparability between different products. Thus, there is a gap in assessment methods for product recyclability based on design decisions. We developed a recyclability assessment method for products that incorporates fundamental product information on material composition and product structure in a simple and concise way. The assessment approach is based on statistical entropy, which is a well-established metric for the evaluation of material distributions. To demonstrate the applicability of the Relative product-inherent recyclability (RPR) assessment developed, a case study is presented in which a modelled smartphone is investigated. The results show that statistical entropy is a valid measure to assess the recyclability of products at the stage of design and thus helps to identify weaknesses in product design. The new metric is intended to address product designers and manufacturers to enable improvements in product design and comparisons between different products. Overall, it should promote the strategies of the European Circular Economy Action Plan regarding product design and recycling.},

The adoption of biogas technology in Africa is promising due to its multitude of benefits including energy generation in the form of biogas, waste management and soil ameliorant production. Furthermore, biogas technology is particularly attractive in Africa due to the economic, environmental and social benefits that are associated with the technology as well as the favourable environmental conditions on the African continent that is conducive to the anaerobic digestion process. Anaerobic digestion of the array of organic waste streams that are available in Africa, which range from agricultural, municipal and industrial waste, could aid in the provision of a renewable energy source (biogas), thereby helping to mitigate energy poverty. The socio-economic benefits of adoption of biogas technology are vast. Technology adoption could result in improved health and agriculture, economic prosperity and social benefits. However, even though the technology is widely exploited in selected developing countries, adoption remains in its infancy on the African continent. This has been attributed to numerous factors that range from elevated initial capital costs, absence of support structures, lack of awareness as well as negative perceptions of the technology cast by past failures. Such hurdles need to be overcome to improve technology adoption and reap the multitude of benefits associated with the technology. This chapter provides a brief overview of the current status of biogas technology adoption in Africa with reference to both household and commercial anaerobic digesters. In addition, the feedstock that may be utilised and its availability for the anaerobic digestion process are highlighted. The societal perception of biogas technology and socio-economic impact associated with technology adoption are also outlined. Lastly, barriers impeding biogas technology adoption in Africa and strategies to promote its adoption are discussed.},

This article analyzes the Colombian informal recycler movement\textemdash a ``least likely'' case for successful mobilization due to the recyclers' extreme marginality and the Colombian state's violent repression of labor movements. The article argues that the rise of neoliberalism and the consolidation of democracy created political opportunities that conventional perspectives on the informal economy would not lead us to expect. Three specific links connected these macro-level transformations to increases in the recyclers' collective organizing capacity. First, technical, financial, and symbolic backing from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) enabled recyclers to develop innovative organizing models. Second, new human rights provisions contained in the Constitution of 1991 created an opening to challenge state policy. Third, the privatization of waste management spurred recyclers to action by leaving them with two clear-cut possibilities: waste corporations might permanently displace them, or recyclers might collectively organize to protect and improve their livelihoods.Desobedeciendo a 150 a\~nos de informes sobre impotencia pol\'itica, millones de trabajadores informales han comenzado recientemente a movilizarse por sus derechos laborales. \textquestiondown Qu\'e provoc\'o este desarrollo inesperado?

As informal workers gain a measure of power to reshape the structure and conditions of their work, but continue to face constraints due to their subordinated positions in the broader political economy, tensions may emerge between the imperatives of combatting exploitation and dispossession. Recent conflicts over recycler rights policy in Bogot\'a, Colombia are illustrative of this dilemma. For the first 25 years of its existence, the recycler rights movement experienced little tension between these two imperatives, as it had little capacity to do either. In recent years, however, recyclers have become powerful political agents, and since 2012 conflicts have erupted among recyclers and state officials over how to navigate the twin threat. Drawing on 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork, this article exposes both potentials and constraints of state-led interventions to improve informal livelihoods. Such interventions are likely to entail thorny tradeoffs as long as they occur within a broader system of social relations that is based on exploitation and exclusion.},

Furthermore, the increased use of computer aided personal survey instruments and internet-based surveys enables researchers to structure the experiments around the very specific experiences of each sampled respondent, adding relevance and comprehendability to the attribute levels being assessed in contrast to other averaging methods to construct reference alternatives.},

Such schemes have particular scope for expansion in peri-urban areas of low-income countries, where large quantities of faecal sludge from onsite sanitation systems are available. However, public acceptability is a critical unknown factor. This study used surveys of 534 peri-urban subsistence farmers in Blantyre, Malawi, to investigate the public acceptability of HEDF. Two factors are highlighted as having a particularly strong association with acceptability: showing a sample of composted, granulated faecal sludge to participants at the start of the survey, and having heard of HEDF before. For instance, almost all participants who were shown the composted, granulated sample and had prior knowledge of HEDF were willing to buy maize grown in HEDF (96\%). Conversely, less than a third of participants who had not heard of HEDF before and were not shown the composted, granulated sample were willing to do so (30\%). Maize was the most widely accepted crop for use with HEDF, as there is perceived to be little contact between the edible parts and the ground. This suggests that HEDF has the potential to be widely accepted by subsistence maize farmers and the general public in Malawi. However, uptake rates could be substantially improved with public engagement campaigns involving demonstrations or samples of a visually appealing product, and by promoting the concept through channels such as farmer radio programmes or agri\- cultural extension workers.},

Qualitative research has highlighted socio-cultural aspects of menstruation, but few quantitative studies have mapped the physical situation at scale. This study surveyed 258 women in Blantyre, Malawi about their menstrual absorbent choices, disposal practices, and socio-demographic characteristics. A Sankey diagram visualised flows of menstrual waste in the urban environment and identified ultimate disposal points. Most participants used either disposable pads and/or old cloth and disposed of them by either burning and/or throwing in pit latrines. Pad and cloth use were associated with age, education, employment, marital status, and household wealth. Younger women's preference for disposable pads suggests that demographic shifts may cause volumes of menstrual waste to increase. However, differences in waste volume produced by disposable and reusable absorbents was less than previously assumed. The volume of menstrual waste discarded in pit latrines, and cultural barriers to disposing it elsewhere, highlights challenges for the pit emptying industry and faecal sludge value recovery sector, with the problem anticipated to be most acute in high-density settlements. Widening access to sustainable disposal strategies, affordable reusable menstrual products, and tackling stigma, are key to addressing this social and environmental challenge.},

While serving many applications because of their durability, stability and low cost, plastics have deleterious effects on the environment. Plastic is known to release a variety of chemicals during degradation, which has a negative impact on biota. Here, we show that the most commonly used plastics produce two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene, when exposed to ambient solar radiation. Polyethylene, which is the most produced and discarded synthetic polymer globally, is the most prolific emitter of both gases. We demonstrate that the production of trace gases from virgin low-density polyethylene increase with time, with rates at the end of a 212-day incubation of 5.8 nmol g-1 d-1 of methane, 14.5 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethylene, 3.9 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethane and 9.7 nmol g-1 d-1 of propylene. Environmentally aged plastics incubated in water for at least 152 days also produced hydrocarbon gases. In addition, low-density polyethylene emits these gases when incubated in air at rates \textasciitilde 2 times and \textasciitilde 76 times higher than when incubated in water for methane and ethylene, respectively.

Despite this, uptake of biogas systems has been slow and sporadic in the region. This review paper investigates what has prevented widespread dissemination of the technology in SSA by looking at the key barriers in the region, as well as identifying the main opportunities and the lessons that can be learned from successful biogas dissemination experiences in Rwanda, Tanzania, China, India, and Nepal. Installation costs, limited awareness and training for biogas users and insufficient follow-up services were recognised as being among the key barriers. SSA has favourable conditions for biogas technology, namely a suitable tropical climate in most parts of the region, a dominance of agricultural activities, and interest in alternatives to expensive conventional energy services. The region׳s favourable conditions therefore provide opportunities for increasing uptake of the technology. Experiences in other regions highlighted the importance of the government in supporting the biogas sector through suitable policies and incentives. Collaboration between research institutions, governmental departments, and biogas users, both current and future, was also recognised as being vital to improve the technology׳s dissemination and appropriate, long-term use.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Recent results from diverse air, ground, and laboratory studies using both radiometric and in situ techniques show that the fractions of black carbon, organic matter, and mineral dust in atmospheric aerosols determine the wavelength dependence of absorption (often expressed as Absorption Angstrom Exponent, or AAE). Taken together, these results hold promise of improving information on aerosol composition from remote measurements. The main purpose of this paper is to show that AAE values for an Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) set of retrievals from Sun-sky measurements describing full aerosol vertical columns are also strongly correlated with aerosol composition or type. In particular, we find AAE values near 1 (the theoretical value for black carbon) for AERONET-measured aerosol columns dominated by urban-industrial aerosol, larger AAE values for biomass burning aerosols, and the largest AAE values for Sahara dust aerosols. These AERONET results are consistent with results from other, very different, techniques, including solar flux-aerosol optical depth (AOD) analyses and airborne in situ analyses examined in this paper, as well as many other previous results. Ambiguities in aerosol composition or mixtures thereof, resulting from intermediate AAE values, can be reduced via cluster analyses that supplement AAE with other variables, for example Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE), which is an indicator of particle size. Together with previous results, these results strengthen prospects for determining aerosol composition from space, for example using the Glory Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS), which seeks to provide retrievals of multiwavelength single-scattering albedo (SSA) and aerosol optical depth (and therefore aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) and AAE), as well as shape and other aerosol properties. Multidimensional cluster analyses promise additional information content, for example by using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to add AAOD in the near ultraviolet and CALIPSO aerosol layer heights to reduce height-absorption ambiguity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {?If an integrated urban waste management system includes the informal recycling sector (IRS), there is a good chance that more solid waste is recycled? is common sense. However, informal integration brings additional social, environmental, and economic benefits, such as reduction of operational costs and environmental impacts of landfilling. Brazil is a global best practice example in terms of waste picker inclusion, and has received international recognition for its recycling levels. In addition to analysing the results of inclusive recycling approaches, this article evaluates a selection of the best Brazilian inclusive recycling practices and summaries and presents the resulting knowledge. The objective is to identify processes that enable the replication of the inclusion of the informal recycling sector model as part of municipal solid waste management. Qualitative and quantitative data have been collected in 25 Brazilian cities that have contracted waste pickers co-operatives for door-to-door selective collection of recyclables. Field data was collected in action research projects that worked with waste pickers co-operatives between 2006 and 2013. The Brazilian informal recycling sector integration model improves municipal solid waste recycling indicators: it shows an increase in the net tonness recycled, from 140 to 208?t?month-1, at a much lower cost per tonne than conventional selective collection systems. Inclusive systems show costs of US\$35 per tonne of recyclables collected, well below the national average of US\$195.26. This inclusive model improves the quality of collected material and the efficiency of municipal selective collection. It also diminishes the negative impacts of informal recycling, by reducing child labour, and by improving the conditions of work, occupational health and safety, and uncontrolled pollution. Although treating the Brazilian experience as a blueprint for transfer of experience in every case is unrealistic, the results suggest that this approach to informal sector integration can be considered among the global best practices for informal sector integration. The article closes with recommendations for deploying technology in other urban areas throughout the world.},

Waste recycling is considered a big source of energy saving and a promoter of CO2 recovery. Besides that, it generates jobs and changes markets worldwide. The Brasilian National Policy on Solid Waste (PNRS) recognizes Waste Pickers as the major social agent in the recycling process responsible for putting Brasil among the ten largest paper-recycling countries in the world. This paper presents an analysis of Brasilian recycling chains of paper and plastics and the main challenges for expanding recycling from Municipal solid waste. The research data were obtained from primary and secondary source related to the recycling supply chain of paper and of the following plastics\textemdash High Density Polyethylene (HDPE),Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polypropylene(PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate(PET) and Polystyrene(PS). Enterprises of various sizes, including informal ones and WPs associations/cooperatives, were visited, in the five Brasilian geographic regions, during the years of 2013 and 2014. A nomenclature was defined for the various enterprises that operate in the Brasilian recycling chain. Each node of the plastic and paper recycling chain was described. The main bottleneck observed in these chains is the lack of continuous programs of selective collection with an emphasis on environmental education processes in the 5570 Brasilian municipalities. Several possibilities not only to promote waste recycling but also to increase the productivity of the sorting process are discussed.},

  abstract = {Carbon emissions from tropical land-use change are a major uncertainty in the global carbon cycle. In African woodlands, small-scale farming and the need for fuel are thought to be reducing vegetation carbon stocks, but quantification of these processes is hindered by the limitations of optical remote sensing and a lack of ground data. Here, we present a method for mapping vegetation carbon stocks and their changes over a 3-year period in a {$>$} 1000 km2 region in central Mozambique at 0.06 ha resolution. L-band synthetic aperture radar imagery and an inventory of 96 plots are combined using regression and bootstrapping to generate biomass maps with known uncertainties. The resultant maps have sufficient accuracy to be capable of detecting changes in forest carbon stocks of as little as 12 MgC ha-1 over 3 years with 95\% confidence. This allows characterization of biomass loss from deforestation and forest degradation at a new level of detail. Total aboveground biomass in the study area was reduced by 6.9 {$\pm$} 4.6\% over 3 years: from 2.13 {$\pm$} 0.12 TgC in 2007 to 1.98 {$\pm$} 0.11 TgC in 2010, a loss of 0.15 {$\pm$} 0.10 TgC. Degradation probably contributed 67\% (96.9 {$\pm$} 91.0 GgC) of the net loss of biomass, but is associated with high uncertainty. The detailed mapping of carbon stock changes quantifies the nature of small-scale farming. New clearances were on average small (median 0.2 ha) and were often additions to already cleared land. Deforestation events reduced biomass from 33.5 to 11.9 MgC ha-1 on average. Contrary to expectations, we did not find evidence that clearances were targeted towards areas of high biomass. Our method is scalable and suitable for monitoring land cover change and vegetation carbon stocks in woodland ecosystems, and can support policy approaches towards reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD).},

Solid cooking fuel was used by 17\% of the full sample but was more common in rural areas. Solid fuel users also had lower socioeconomic status. Compared to those using gas, solid fuel users had lower baseline scores and faster decline in Verbal Learning ({$\beta$} = -0.18, p {$<$} 0.05), Visual Scanning ({$\beta$} = -1.00, p {$<$} 0.001), and Verbal Fluency ({$\beta$} = -0.33, p {$<$} 0.001).

The main objective of this study was to quantify the e-waste inventory and it's processing from major cities of Pakistan to evaluate its generation (domestic/import) and recycling practices. This study comprises the information of only those e-waste items (desktop computers, laptops/notebooks, computer monitors and liquid-crystal display units) which form the major portion of e-waste imported to Pakistan. Survey based data collected from three major cities/areas have been extrapolated to develop an e-waste generation inventory for the country. The study reveals that approximately 50 kt of e-waste is being imported as scrap in addition to its local generation of about 38 kt per year. During field visits and data collection surveys, it has been observed that the processing of e-waste in the country is being carried out in crude manner without safety gears.

Engaging with critical legal theory, the author argues that in a social world where most people do not read, understand, or cite court rulings, the ?social uses of the law? can be of greater import than the actual judgement. This does not, however, render the state absent, as the assertion that the court sanctioned particular claims and rights is central to the reclaimers? social uses of the law. Through the social uses of the law, these reclaimers force us to consider how and why the law, one of the cornerstones of state formation, cannot be separated from the informal ways it is understood and deployed.

We argue that residents and reclaimers play active roles in shaping official S@S on the ground, and cannot be ignored when developing S@S programmes. Furthermore, S@S and integration are inherently related, as they each target the same residents and the same recyclables, and therefore cannot be understood or addressed in isolation. Unless a specific commitment is made to integrate S@S, S@S becomes a reclaimer dis-integration programme.

  abstract = {A source apportionment study was performed for particulate matter in the small village of Roveredo, Switzerland, where more than 70\% of the households use wood burning for heating purposes. A two-lane trans-Alpine highway passes through the village and contributes to the total aerosol burden in the area. The village is located in a steep Alpine valley characterized by strong and persistent temperature inversions during winter, especially from December to February. During two winter and one early spring campaigns, a seven-wavelength aethalometer, high volume (HIVOL) samplers, an Aerodyne quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), an optical particle counter (OPC), and a Sunset Laboratory OCEC analyzer were deployed to study the contribution of wood burning and traffic aerosols to particulate matter. A linear regression model of the carbonaceous particulate mass in the submicrometer size range CM(PM1) as a function of aerosol light absorption properties measured by the aethalometer is introduced to estimate the particulate mass from wood burning and traffic (PMwb, PMtraffic). This model was calibrated with analyses from the 14C method using HIVOL filter measurements. These results indicate that light absorption exponents of 1.1 for traffic and 1.8\textendash 1.9 for wood burning calculated from the light absorption at 470 and 950 nanometers should be used to obtain agreement of the two methods regarding the relative wood burning and traffic emission contributions to CM(PM1) and also to black carbon. The resulting PMwb and PMtraffic values explain 86\% of the variance of the CM(PM1) and contribute, on average, 88 and 12\% to CM(PM1), respectively. The black carbon is estimated to be 51\% due to wood burning and 49\% due to traffic emissions. The average organic carbon/total carbon (OC/TC) values were estimated to be 0.52 for traffic and 0.88 for wood burning particulate emissions.},

  abstract = {Recent research and initiatives increasingly propose a new approach, based on distributed plastic recycling for open-source (OS) 3D printing technologies, as a way to deal with the issue of plastic waste and to support the development of the circular economy (CE). Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of ``smart grid'', composed of small and coordinated recycling units. However, the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated. This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective, as a step towards its validation. To achieve this, an optimization mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was used as an evaluation tool, representing a local closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network. The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France. Following this step, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations (price of virgin plastic filament) and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools. The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling. This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts.},

  abstract = {In Uruguay, potable water services\textemdash privatized during the neoliberal period\textemdash were set to return to the public sphere in the mid-2000s. This was a promising scenario as it entailed a wide scope for development. However, over a decade after this process was set in motion, the results are discouraging. The new problems in public water management have to do with outsourcing key areas and covert privatization processes. Furthermore, rate reforms transferred the problems created in natural water basins to mass users, which implies a form of water privatization as the entire society subsidizes the environmental costs of pollution (Ribeiro, 2006). There is a wide variety of gray areas between the public management model, where service provision is a common good and a state responsibility, and the private management model, where the service becomes a commodity. This paper analyzes the restatization and public management of drinking water services in Uruguay according to a state logic and its inertias in the transition from neoliberal to progressive administrations. Institutional inertia is critical in these experiences because it renders services the joint and complex result of combining a state logic and a privatization logic, where public oversight and community participation are mentioned by some government authorities but excluded in practice. This is what Gautreau and Perrier have called neoliberal resilience (2019). These logics intertwine perversely in key management areas, such as rate structures.},

Data were obtained through daily conversations with scavengers who deal with recyclables in the site. Seven processing steps of informal recycling were observed at the site. Scavengers at the site were referred to as their managerial names in their community, and then at least 8 types of recycling actors were identified: 1) big boss, 2) small boss, 3) big middleman, 4)~small middleman, 5) live-in waste picker, 6) live-out waste picker, 7) independent waste picker, and 8)~daily worker. Live-in and live-out waste pickers were continuously employed by their bosses, while independent waste pickers and daily workers depended on temporary employer\textendash employee relationships. The positions of the recycling actors were not always fixed and there were many paths of career tracks and setbacks mainly due to individual economic status. All big bosses and big middlemen have built direct connections with recycling factories, and the community of scavengers in the site recognized them as big bosses and big middlemen due to the connections. A big boss of waste pickers, mainly dealing with plastic recyclables, was intensively investigated to clarify the buyer\textendash seller relationship between the boss and other recycling actors. Common ground between formal and informal sectors should be built for making new waste management policies in the way that the existing informal recycling system is successfully integrated into the formal recycling system.},

The first author did fieldwork for totally 16 months at the site and quantitative field surveys were conducted twice during the period. All respondents in the first round quantitative survey (n=1390) were categorized as follows: waste pickers, family workers, wage labors, bosses, family of the bosses, housewives, pupils/students, preschoolers, the unemployed, and others. Based on the results of the second round quantitative survey (n=69 households), their average household income was estimated to be approximately US 216 dollars per month (n=59 households), which was virtually equivalent to the minimum wage in Jakarta in 2013. Living conditions of scavengers at the site were horrible, and their working conditions were dangerous due to medical waste and other sharp waste. Polluted groundwater was one of the serious environmental problems at the site. Despite the social, health and environmental problems, they were attracted to the freedom of entering the informal recycling system in Bantar Gebang and withdrawing from the system, in which a lot of opportunities were provided for the people having few marketable skills to obtain cash earnings. The freedom of their choice should be guaranteed as a prerequisite before integrating the informal sector into formal waste management. Furthermore, special attentions are required when incomes of scavengers are the same level as minimum wages and the national economy is rapidly growing, because scavengers cannot easily change their jobs due to few marketable skills. Indonesian national waste laws and regulations should be properly applied to facilitate a socialization process at final disposal sites. Measures need to be taken to prevent children from working as informal recycling actors, especially for waste pickers aged 15 or younger.},

  abstract = {Local communities who live close to protected tropical forests often depend on them for woodfuel, their main source of energy. The impacts of fuelwood extraction in humid forests are rarely studied, yet the extraction of wood for fuel can impact forest structure, function and biodiversity. We assessed the effects of fuelwood collection on the forest of Mt Elgon National Park (Uganda). We interviewed 192 households about fuelwood use and surveyed dead wood in 81 plots inside the park. Forest was the most important source of fuelwood. People collected on average between 1.1 and 2.0m3 of fuelwood per capita per year. Other activities involving wood fuel extraction from the forest included illegal commercial fuelwood harvesting and charcoal making. Quantities of dead wood were affected by fuelwood collection up to at least 1000m inside the boundary of the park. Depletion of dead wood inside the park was greater in the sites where the population was most dense. Nevertheless, people who planted more trees on their own land perceived land outside the park to be important and valued old growth forest less as a source of fuelwood. Highly-preferred tree species were most depleted, particularly when they were also valued timber trees, such as Prunus africana, Popocarpus milianjianus, Allophylus abyssinicus and Olea spp. Locally dominant species were less affected. Impacts varied among sites depending on the history of agricultural encroachment and locally-specific forest uses, e.g. harvesting of trees for poles or use of the forest land for grazing. Allowing the collection of dead wood in forests is double-edged as it creates opportunities for other activities that are more damaging. Demand for wood fuel from tropical forests is still likely to grow in the foreseeable future. Our results indicate that the forest may become more degraded as a result, with negative consequences for the people who depend on the forest and for conservation. Research into local ecological and cultural contexts and perceptions concerning costs and benefits can help devise more sustainable management options, including alternative sources of fuel.},

OTTR allows content creators to publish material to multiple massive online learner communities using familiar rendering mechanics. OTTR allows the incorporation of pedagogical practices like formative and summative assessments in the form of multiple choice questions and fill in the blank problems that are automatically graded. No local installation of any software is required to begin creating content with OTTR. Thus far, 15 courses have been created with OTTR repository template.

With the help of modest economic growth and an associated increase in per capita household income, the introduction and expansion of social grants has helped alleviate the inherited burden of poverty. On the other hand income inequality has remained stubbornly high in post-apartheid South Africa and the role of these grants in inequality reduction remains unclear. We use national household survey data from 1993 and 2008 and the major income inequality decomposition techniques in order to assess the impact of a change in these government transfers on inequality. This South African case study allows for a side-by-side assessment of these income inequality decomposition techniques. We find that the social assistance awarded to the elderly has contributed dramatically to the decline in poverty but has not reduced income inequality. On the other hand social protection programs directed at child minders of poor children had an equalizing effect. More recent decomposition techniques allow us to net out the effect of changes in household composition on inequality from these impacts. This is shown to notably lower the direct impact of the social grants on inequality.},

Equitable access to sanitation, including emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total recorded 5653 emptying events, 27\% were located outside Kampala city boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37\% were classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision accounted for 13\% of the total area. Service provision normalised by population density revealed much greater service provision in medium- and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs.},

Some women use such discourse as a perfect scenario to criticize some men's behavior. Indeed, they usually do so with Oppressed Traditional Masculinities (OTM) but not with Dominant Traditional Masculinities (DTM), who are the men who were violent with those women and with whom some of those women chose to have relationships. However, there have always been men who have been on the side of women and have never committed violence against them. Therefore, New Alternative Masculinities (NAM) reject being indicated as guilty of the violence committed against women by DTM. Through a communicative approach, applying six semi-structured interviews with a communicative orientation and a communicative data analysis of all information, this article explores both women's communicative acts that blame OTM for what DTM have done to women and NAM's reactions to these accusations to stop such blaming to make it possible to overcome hegemonic discourses.}

Transitioning to a circular economy that retains plastic in its highest value condition is essential to reduce environmental impacts, promoting reduction, reuse, and recycling. Mechanical recycling is an essential tool in an environmentally and economically sustainable economy of plastics, but current mechanical recycling processes are limited by cost, degradation of mechanical properties, and inconsistent quality products. This review covers the current methods and challenges for the mechanical recycling of the five main packaging plastics: poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chloride) through the lens of a circular economy. Their reprocessing induced degradation mechanisms are introduced and strategies to improve their recycling are discussed. Additionally, this review briefly examines approaches to improve polymer blending in mixed plastic waste streams and applications of lower quality recyclate.},

There is convincing evidence that PM, almost regardless of source, has detrimental health effects. An important issue in health impact assessments is what metric, indicator and exposure-response function to use for different types of PM. The aim of this study is to describe sectorial contributions to PM exposure and related premature mortality for three Swedish cities: Gothenburg, Stockholm and Umea. Exposure is calculated with high spatial resolution using atmospheric dispersion models. Attributed premature mortality is calculated separately for the main local sources and the contribution from long-range transport (LRT), applying different relative risks. In general, the main part of the exposure is due to LRT, while for black carbon, the local sources are equally or more important. The major part of the premature deaths is in our assessment related to local emissions, with road traffic and residential wood combustion having the largest impact. This emphasizes the importance to resolve within-city concentration gradients when assessing exposure. It also implies that control actions on local PM emissions have a strong potential in abatement strategies.},

The programme provides a monthly cash payment of 60 kwacha (US\$12) to very poor households with children under five years old. A randomised controlled trial of 2,515 households was implemented to investigate the impact of the programme. We find that cash transfers improve household consumption, food consumption, diet diversity and food security. These outcomes lie along the causal pathway linking the cash transfer to children's nutrition. For children under five, we observe positive but not statistically significant impacts of the programme on weight. We find strong and significant heterogeneous impacts on reducing stunting among children who have access to clean water or more educated mothers. The results demonstrate that nutrition can be improved through an integrated and holistic strategy instead of only pursuing targeted programmes in one sector such as health or agriculture.},

  abstract = {In the context of global debates on how to `formalise' informal workers, work in the waste and recycling sectors has shifted to focus on the `integration' of reclaimers (also known as waste pickers). This article analyses a pilot project conducted by the City of Johannesburg and its Pikitup waste management utility at the Robinson Deep landfill to explore how contested understandings of `integration' by officials and reclaimers shape integration programmes and their perceived successes and failures. The article establishes that reclaimers and officials held almost diametrically opposed conceptualisations of integration. This conceptual rift, and Pikitup and the City's ability to enforce their interpretation, played a central role in the failure of the pilot. The article contends that academic literature on integration should critically interrogate the power-laden, contested processes through which particular conceptualisations of integration are adopted in specific places, and the resultant implications for reclaimers. This approach can potentially~offer new ways of analysing initiatives to meaningfully improve conditions and incomes of informal workers in other sectors, and spark conversation on what it would mean to focus on integration rather than formalisation in these other areas of work. At a more pragmatic level, the article concludes that any integration process must start with reclaimers and officials collectively developing a common conceptualisation of integration, while also acknowledging the challenges in doing so in the context of profoundly unequal power relations between them.}

The hypotheses are that supply, manufacturing, maintenance, distribution, and post-consumption processes offer opportunities to reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling used materials and parts. The research method is the multiple case studies in three companies in the process industry: beverages, packaging, and construction chemicals. The main research techniques were document analysis, meeting with experts and guided visits, and non-participant observation. The study concluded that the combination of channels and processes with higher potential for value recovery are reuse in manufacture and distribution, remanufacturing in maintenance, and recycling in postconsumption.

  abstract = {Strict environmental regulations and diminishing raw material resources have strengthened the importance of reverse logistics at an increasing rate. However a substantial amount of risk is involved in the reverse supply chain which has to be managed by organisations effectively. The risks associated with reverse logistics have however not been addressed appropriately. In response to this knowledge gap, this study aims to prioritize the risks in reverse logistics Risk prioritisation is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this work, risks involved in reverse logistics are prioritised using hybrid multi-criteria decision making methods. A case of plastic recycling firm is discussed for the illustration of the approach. The major contribution of this work lies in the development of linkages among the various functions in reverse logistics. The results indicate that managing inventory has a significant impact on reverse logistics. It was observed that social concern with respect to protecting the environment in general is based on the cooperation of customers. The findings of the study will provide useful insight to the supply chain managers and researchers for decision-making in reverse logistics.},

  abstract = {Fuelwood and charcoal are fundamental fuel sources for the residential sector in Mexico. A Business-As-Usual (BAU) projection by means of a spatially-explicit approach was developed to assess national fuelwood and charcoal consumption for the period 2010 to 2030. The model was calibrated for 1990-2000 and 2010 projections were validated against official census data for the same year. For 2010, we estimated that fuelwood and charcoal accounted for 48\% of total residential energy demand. The projection of fuelwood consumption declined slightly from 19.4 Mt (dry matter) or 310 PJ in 2010 to 18.4 Mt or 294 PJ by 2030. An important future growth of mixed fuelwood-LPG users is expected pointing out that fuel stacking rather than fuel switching out of fuelwood would prevail. Charcoal consumption increased from 3.8 Mt (dried wood equivalent) or 61 PJ to 4.7 Mt or 75 PJ during the same period. A relevant outcome of the spatial assessment was the uncovering of large variations in fuelwood and charcoal use trends among spatial units (municipalities), hidden by the national aggregated trends. This opens up the opportunity to analyze regional variability to identify priority areas regarding fuelwood and charcoal use. (C) 2013 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to articulate the role and welfare of donkeys used in waste management. We conducted interviews with donkey owners (n = 200), households which use donkey carts for waste collection (n = 50) and key informants (n = 14). To assess the welfare of donkeys, the Standardised Equine-Based Welfare Assessment Tool (SEBWAT) was used (n = 204). Collection of waste was the primary source of income for 89\% of owners interviewed. Of those directly involved in waste collection, 62\% were found to be under 18 years of age. During interviews with donkey cart customers the majority reported that there would be a huge garbage build-up if donkey carts were not available. Welfare assessments demonstrated that 52.9\% of donkeys had a body condition score of two. Muzzle mutilation was extremely high (78.4\%) and 66.7\% of donkeys had superficial knee lesions. This is the first study that has explored the role of donkey carts in waste management in Pakistan. The data demonstrate the sizable role that donkey-owning communities play in waste management and the important livelihood option this offers, as well as considerable animal welfare concerns.},

The results present that the major indicators had obvious regional differences, which can divide Africa into three levels: North Africa and South Africa {$>$} West Africa and Central Africa {$>$} East Africa. Besides, the disposal methods in North Africa, South Africa and West Africa have evolved from simple open dumping to sanitary landfill, composting and recycle treatment, while opening dumping is still rampant in East Africa. With a combination tool of Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression, it was identified that eco\- nomic growth, urbanization and geographical location are the most critical factors influencing the unbalanced statue of MSW management in Africa.

  abstract = {This research report is an ethnographic study of the everyday work-life of informal street reclaimers from Bekezela in Newtown, Johannesburg. The focus is on seven black male reclaimers and one black female reclaimer who informally salvage recyclable materials from rubbish bins and sell them to buy-back centers (BBC) to earn a living. The Bekezela reclaimers start work at 3:30 am, walking far distances in the darkness to reach the wealthy suburbs that are the richest source of recyclables. While it is often assumed that reclaimers are fiercely independent, the research found that these reclaimers who live together in Belezela ended up reclaiming together. They also formed the Royals and Bekezela Plus (informal organisations studied in this report) to create social and economic security and stability. These organisations were developed over time to build trust, loyalty and accountability. By following the daily, embodied work of the eight Bekezela reclaimers, the report develops a nuanced understanding reclaimers as complex people who develop social relations and associations as they conduct complex work that entails multiple areas of specialization learned from each other in the streets. Without any attention to this rich social world, Johannesburg's Pikitup waste management utility implemented a separation at source (S@S) programme that pays private companies to do the same work as reclaimers. Having illuminated the rich social life of reclaimers, the report is then able to analyse the multiple ways that the city's S@S programme disrupts their social world. The report argues that the S@S programme undermines the ability of informal reclaimers to pursue their work and life projects without providing any credible alternatives. The report concludes by exploring how reclaimers in Bekezela, together with reclaimers from across the city who are members of the African Reclaimers Organisation (ARO), are contesting S@S and mobilizing for an approach to S@S that recognizes, builds on and strengthens their life projects. At the same time, the report identifies how the 8 reclaimers do not necessarily have interest or faith in this type of more formal organization.},

A survey was conducted of above-ground timber species, using random sampling. A tree-ring chronology for Pinus roxburghii was created to construct a growth model representative of the various mainly-pine species. The allometric model combined with tree ring analysis was used to estimate carbon stock and annual growth in the above-ground tree biomass. The out-take of forest biomass for construction material and fuelwood was estimated on the basis of interviews and official records of community forest user groups. The average annual carbon increment of the community forests was 2.19~ton/ha, and the average annual carbon out-take of timber and fuelwood was 0.25~ton/ha. The net average carbon balance of 1.94~ton/ha was equivalent to 117.44~tons of carbon per community forest annually. All the community forests were actively managed leading to a sustainable forest institution, which acts as a carbon sink. It is concluded that community forests have the potential to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation and forest degradation, enhance forest carbon sink and improve livelihoods for local communities.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the phenomenon of rebound effects in relation to a transition to a Circular Economy (CE) through qualitative inquiry. The aim is to gain insights in manifestations of rebound effects by studying the Dutch textile industry as it transitions to a circular system, and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies that can be applied to ensure an effective transition. The rebound effect, known originally from the energy efficiency literature, occurs when improvements in efficiency or other technological innovations fail to deliver on their environmental promise due to (behavioral) economic mechanisms. The presence of rebound in CE contexts can therefore lead to the structural overstatement of environmental benefits of certain innovations, which can influence reaching emission targets and the preference order of recycling. In this research, the CE rebound effect is investigated in the Dutch textile industry, which is identified as being vulnerable to rebound, yet with a positive potential to avoid it. The main findings include the very low awareness of this effect amongst key stakeholders, and the identification of specific and general instances of rebound effects in the investigated industry. In addition, the relation of these effects to Circular Business Models and CE strategies are investigated, and placed in a larger context in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding about the place and role of this effect in the transition. This concerns the necessity for a new approach to how design has been practiced traditionally, and the need to place transitional developments in a systems perspective. Propositions that serve as theory-building blocks are put forward and include suggestions for further research and recommendations about dealing with rebound effects and shaping an eco-effective transition.},

However, a systemic perspective that addresses the complex interdependencies across the value chain has so far been missing from the analysis. Based on a qualitative study covering the entire plastics value chain in Finland and Northern Europe, this paper addresses the research gap with two main findings. First, the paper identifies three core conundrums that describe the complex and interrelated nature of technological, operational, economic, and societal factors, which are inhibiting the transition to sustainable plastics at three critical junctures of the value chain. Second, the findings describe four solution mechanisms, which suggest that the value chain actors need to shift (i) from the supply of bulk materials to material solutions; (ii) from firm-centric material development to cross-tier collaboration; (iii) from price competition to competition on sustainability benefits; and (iv) from isolated technologies to infrastructure development. These findings extend our understanding of the systemic challenges for the transition to a sustainable plastics economy and shed new light on the ways in which companies can address the challenges for a system-wide impact.},

Levoglucosan and the related degradation products from cellulose can be utilized as specific and general indicator compounds for the presence of emissions from biomass burning in samples of atmospheric fine particulate matter. This enables the potential tracking of such emissions on a global basis. There are other compounds (e.g. amyrones, friedelin, dehydroabietic acid, and thermal derivatives from terpenoids and from lignin\textemdash syringaldehyde, vanillin, syringic acid, vanillic acid), which are additional key indicators in smoke from burning of biomass specific to the type of biomass fuel. The monosaccharide derivatives (e.g. levoglucosan) are proposed as specific indicators for cellulose in biomass burning emissions. Levoglucosan is emitted at such high concentrations that it can be detected at considerable distances from the original combustion source. 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Poor air quality is a development challenge. Urbanization and industrial development along with increased populations have brought clear socio-economic benefits to Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) but can also bring disadvantages such as decreasing air quality. A lack of reliable air quality data in East African cities makes it difficult to understand air pollution exposure and to predict future air quality trends. This work documents urban air quality and air pollution exposure in the capital cities of Kampala (Uganda), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Nairobi (Kenya). We build a situational awareness of air pollution through repeated static and dynamic mobile monitoring in a range of urban locations, including urban background, roadside (pavement and building), rural background, and bus station sites, alongside vehicle-based measurements including buses and motorcycle taxis. Data suggest that the measured particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5, PM10) in all studied cities was at high concentrations, and often hazardous to human health, as defined by WHO air quality guidelines. Overall, the poorest air quality was observed in Kampala, where mean daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were significantly above the WHO limits at urban background locations by 122\% and 69\% and at roadside locations by 193\% and 215\%, respectively. Traffic is clearly a major contributor to East African urban air pollution; monitoring in Kampala and Addis Ababa, on motorcycle taxis, in buses and at bus stations indicated that drivers and commuters were exposed to poor air quality throughout their commute. Road-related air pollution can also impact indoor locations near roads. Using one exemplar building located within Nairobi's Central Business District, it is shown that measured outdoor PM concentrations significantly correlate with the indoor air quality (r=0.84). This link between roadside emissions and indoor air pollution within buildings located close to the road should be explored more fully. This study, through a series of case studies, provides clear evidence that roads and traffic need to be a focus for mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution exposure in East African cities.},

While this dimension has been acknowledged to play an important role in the construction of private good preferences, however, in the context of public good, the role of social interaction has not been adequately examined. Therefore, to shed a light on the role of social interaction in shaping preferences toward public good, I conduct a contingent valuation (CV) study in which the respondents are enabled to have social interactions prior their willingness to pay (WTP) elicitation question. And in order to do this, I construct a sampling design where respondents are divided into three different groups, namely treated, untreated, and control groups. The respondents in the treated and untreated groups were allowed to interact/discuss with each other, within and across groups, prior to the WTP elicitation question. I find that treated and untreated respon-dents with social interactions have higher and significant likelihood to purchase the public good relatively to control respondents. While those who did not have interaction have a lower WTP for the improvement of waste management.},

The developed SPAMS was calibrated in the laboratory and vali- dated through field measurements. Field measurements were performed by walking on footpaths and travelling in the bus during various times of a day and different days in a week at selected locations in Chennai city, India. Re- sults indicated that the PM2.5 concentration was highest in busy traffic site (mean = 22.7 {$\pm$} 8.45 {$\mu$}g/m3) and lowest in urban background (mean = 9.3 {$\pm$} 5.75 {$\mu$}g/m3). Whereas, the CO concentration was lowest at beach road (mean = 0.26 {$\pm$} 0.01 ppm). Not much variation was observed in the average concentrations of NO2 and O3. On the other hand, while travelling in buses, higher concentration of CO and NO2 were observed during the morning and evening periods due to the peaking traffic flow. On contrary O3 concentration was found to be highest during afternoon due to photochemical reactions.},

Whilst the literature on resource allocation in health care attests to the political nature of decision making, this has remained largely under-theorized and therefore priority setters may be unfamiliar with the analytic benefits of applying insights from the broader political sciences. Conversely, policy scientists may know relatively little about existing research on how healthcare organizations make allocative and redistributive decisions. This paper aims to open a dialogue between these solitudes by exploring political effects on health care priority setting, using the interpretive concepts ideas, interests and institutions.},

Application of untreated manures provides high input of available nutrients, which results in an initial flush in crop growth. However, risks of losing nutrients are high because manure is usually applied before sowing to avoid reduced yields due to phytotoxicity, resulting in increased losses by leaching or volatilization. Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of untreated manures results in immobilization of nutrients by carbon-rich materials. A greater amount of nutrients are potentially available to crops from applied bioslurry. Typically 5\textendash 10\% of the nitrogen is lost during anaerobic digestion, but bioslurry provides immediately available nutrients that can be applied as needed, so reducing risks of nutrient loss. If, however, bioslurry was applied in a single dose, losses would be similar in magnitude to untreated manures. Risks of nutrient losses are also lower when wastes are applied as composts, but in contrast to bioslurry, this is because the concentration of immediately available nutrients is very low, most nutrients being held in organic form that will become available only slowly over the growing season. Composts provide an option for single dose application, but a larger proportion of nitrogen is lost during composting (26\textendash 51\%) than during anaerobic digestion (5\textendash 10\%). Losses of nitrogen during pyrolysis are also very high (70\textendash 90\%), but biochar can reduce losses of native soil nutrients by providing exchange sites that hold nutrients in the soil.},

Like many municipal parks, Gunnersbury Park in West London is experiencing the effects of local government budget cuts. Governance, policy and physical changes have been introduced to reduce dependence on public funding and the result is a more commercially oriented park. This case is used to better understand how the period of neoliberal austerity 2010?2019 reshaped municipal parks. The paper highlights concerns over the transparency and accountability of the social enterprise that now manages Gunnersbury Park. It also shows how neoliberalisation and commercialisation are manifested in the park landscape: free events are replaced with ticketed ones, spaces for sport are transformed into bookable facilities, cafes are taken over by corporate chains and playgrounds are supplemented with paid entry alternatives. One of the main consequences is the financial and symbolic exclusion of those unable or unwilling to pay. The paper explores who has contested the recent changes, and why. Opponents are dismissed as idealistic NIMBYs but, by refusing to accept the post-political inevitability of park neoliberalisation, they are helping to ensure Gunnersbury Park remains a public and open space. The case is contextualised by situating it within a review of new park governance arrangements across London, and by comparing neoliberalisation processes here with those affecting New York parks. Ultimately, the research highlights the pitfalls of shifting away from the public funding and public management of municipal parks.},

Regulatory agencies must ensure the safety of waste management alternatives for two very different profiles of generators: (1) hospitals, which concentrate the production of HCW and (2) small establishments, such as clinics, pharmacies and other sources, that generate dispersed quantities of HCW and are scattered throughout the city. To assist in developing sector regulations for the small generators, we evaluated three management scenarios using decision-making tools. They consisted of a disinfection technique (microwave, autoclave and lime) followed by landfilling, where transportation was also included. The microwave, autoclave and lime techniques were tested at the laboratory to establish the operating parameters to ensure their efficiency in disinfection. Using a life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost analysis, the decision-making tools aimed to determine the technique with the best environmental performance. This consisted of evaluating the eco-efficiency of each scenario. Based on the life cycle assessment, microwaving had the lowest environmental impact (12.64Pt) followed by autoclaving (48.46Pt). The cost analyses indicated values of US\$0.12kg-1 for the waste treated with microwaves, US\$1.10kg-1 for the waste treated by the autoclave and US\$1.53kg-1 for the waste treated with lime. The microwave disinfection presented the best eco-efficiency performance among those studied and provided a feasible alternative to subsidize the formulation of the policy for small generators of HCW.},

Studies show that girls in many countries experience menarche with insufficient information and support. Girls from around the world report feeling ashamed and afraid. The potential health effects of such experiences include a weakening of girls' sense of self-confidence and competence, which in turn may comprise girls' abilities to assert themselves in different situations, including in relation to their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health. There is an important need for the public health community to assure that girls receive the education and support they need about menstruation, so they are able to feel more confident about their bodies, and navigate preventable health problems \textendash{} now and in the future. For too long, the global health community has overlooked the window of opportunity presented by menarche. Family planning programs have generally focused their efforts on married couples and HIV programs have focused safer sex promotion on older adolescent girls and boys. Starting the conversation at menarche with girls in early adolescence would fully use this window of opportunity. It would engage young adolescent girls and be a natural first step for later, more comprehensive conversations about sexuality, reproduction and reproductive health. There are a number of initiatives beginning to tackle the provision of puberty information to girls and boys, but the global health community is overdue to set a global standard for the provision of such guidance.},

  abstract = {The industrial production of poly (ethylene terephthalate), PET, continues to increase and thus it is important to understand the composition of fumes resulting from its disposal as a part of incinerated waste. In this study samples of PET material were combusted in a furnace corresponding to the German standard DIN 53,436 at temperatures of 500\textdegree C, 800\textdegree C (in an air flow) and also uncontrolled combustion in air. The gaseous products were then analysed using three different analytical methods: high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, acetylene, formaldehyde (methanal) and acetaldehyde (ethanal) were detected by FTIR. Water, methane, acetaldehyde, ethylene, formaldehyde, methanol, acetone, benzene, terephthalic acid, styrene (ethenylbenzene), ethanol, toluene (methylbenzene), xylene (dimethylbenzene), ethylbenzene, naphthalene, biphenyl and phenol concentrations were all quantified by both SIFT-MS and GC-MS. Additionally, the fumes resulting from uncontrolled combustion in air were analysed by FTIR which resolves the rotation\textendash vibration structure of the absorption bands of formaldehyde (2779.90 and 2778.48 cm-1) and propane, which was identified from characteristic vibrations of CH3 groups at 2977.00 and 2962.00 cm-1. The spectra were compared with reference standards.},

  abstract = {This paper explores and contrasts the different social processes of valuation now appearing as economic means of valuing the environment. Monetary valuation via stated preference approaches has been criticised for assuming well formed and informed preferences and excluding a range of sustainability concerns such as rights, fairness and equity. Deliberative monetary valuation (DMV) in small groups is a novel hybrid of economic and political approaches which raises the prospect of a transformative and moralising experience. Critics of standard contingent valuation approaches have advocated this as offering a way forward. However there has been a lack of clarity as to the means of obtaining values, the expected outcomes and their role. Moving to group settings of deliberation raises concepts of social willingness to pay and accept which are distinct from an aggregate of individual value, although this does not seem to have been widely recognised. A new classification of values is presented appropriate to the literature trying to merge economic and political processes. Values associated with the individual may be exchange values, charitable contributions or fair prices, while social values can be speculative, expressive or arbitrated. The use of DMV is shown to result in different values due to variations in the institutional setting and process of valuation.},

  abstract = {Poor sanitation remains a major public health concern linked to several important health outcomes; emerging evidence indicates a link to childhood stunting. In India over half of the population defecates in the open; the prevalence of stunting remains very high. Recently published data on levels of stunting in 112 districts of India provide an opportunity to explore the relationship between levels of open defecation and stunting within this population. We conducted an ecological regression analysis to assess the association between the prevalence of open defecation and stunting after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Data from the 2011 HUNGaMA survey was used for the outcome of interest, stunting; data from the 2011 Indian Census for the same districts was used for the exposure of interest, open defecation. After adjustment for various potential confounding factors \textendash including socio-economic status, maternal education and calorie availability \textendash{} a 10 percent increase in open defecation was associated with a 0.7 percentage point increase in both stunting and severe stunting. Differences in open defecation can statistically account for 35 to 55 percent of the average difference in stunting between districts identified as low-performing and high-performing in the HUNGaMA data. In addition, using a Monte Carlo simulation, we explored the effect on statistical power of the common practice of dichotomizing continuous height data into binary stunting indicators. Our simulation showed that dichotomization of height sacrifices statistical power, suggesting that our estimate of the association between open defecation and stunting may be a lower bound. Whilst our analysis is ecological and therefore vulnerable to residual confounding, these findings use the most recently collected large-scale data from India to add to a growing body of suggestive evidence for an effect of poor sanitation on human growth. New intervention studies, currently underway, may shed more light on this important issue.},

The rapid pace of increase in population, economic growth, urbanization and industrialization is coupled with accelerated solid waste generation. In most of the developing countries wastes are either scattered in urban centers or disposed off unplanned in low lying areas or open dumps. The lack of infrastructure for collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid waste, proper solid waste management planning, insufficient financial resources, technical expertise and public attitude have made the situation exasperating due to which several environmental and health related problems are increasing. Though, there are many negative issues related to solid waste, it also provides many opportunities that not only mitigates its negative impact but also helps in meeting the demand for energy and employment generation as well as in soil health improvement. Keeping in mind the present situation the current review was planned with the objective to overlook the challenges and opportunities faced during urban solid waste management in developing countries like India.},

  abstract = {In Germany Bio waste is collected in separate garbage bins from households in the municipalities (e.g. garden waste, kitchen waste, etc.) and composted. The end result is humus, which is finally fed back into agriculture and closes the organic materials cycle. Waste must be inspected for non-biological contaminants prior to composting, as these can compromise the composting process and damage screening equipment at the recycling facility. Undetected contaminants affect the quality of the humus and can lead to contaminants re-entering the food chain through agriculture. The paper presents a feasibility study of an automatic bio waste Contamination-Scanner aiming to catch contamination early in the recycling process. Image data of bio waste contamination has been collected from a recycling facility. These images were used to design, train and evaluate two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aimed at detecting contaminants during bio waste collection. One CNN was trained on RGB and the other on greyscale images. The results show an initial surface scan can detect contamination with an accuracy of up~to 86\% and could form part of a holistic detector attached to bin lorries.},

  abstract = {In this research I explored the experiences of homeless and unstably-housed men who use a bicycle in Vancouver, Canada. Bicycling, the fastest growing mode of transportation in Vancouver (City of Vancouver, 2018), has become popularized due to its associations with positive health, economic, and environmental outcomes. Cycling has been taken up by upwardly-mobile and often white city-dwellers as a lifestyle choice signifying environmentally-conscious and responsible citizenship (Golub, Hoffman, Lugo, \& Sandoval, 2016; Green, Steinbach \& Datta, 2012). At the same time, many people who are homeless or unstably-housed may depend on walking and cycling for transportation, and may cycle out of necessity, not by choice (Lugo, 2018). To date, however, cycling scholarship tends to focus on infrastructure implementation or the public health benefits of cycling, and frames cyclists in a commuter-leisure dichotomy (Mayers \& Glover, 2019). As a result, little is known about the experiences of low-income people who cycle out of necessity. Relatedly, more research is needed regarding how cycling is connected to larger issues of inequality, such as Vancouver's current housing crisis, opioid epidemic, and settler-colonial history. The study was guided by critical and interpretive theoretical perspectives that helped bring attention to social inequities and the experiences and perspectives of marginalized individuals. Using primarily ride-along interviews, I did five in-depth semi-structured interviews with homeless or unstably-housed men who ride bicycles. Results indicate that bicycles were used for a variety of reasons, including for leisure, for transport, and for informal recycling work. The bicycle was a mobility aid for participants who had multiple health issues. Participants met their bike-related needs through an underground economy and a network of places and people. They cultivated relationships along these networks that helped them `get by' despite experiencing significant stigma from the public and from police, as well as structural barriers. These results suggest that homeless and unstably-housed men who use bicycles employ varied and creative means to get by, and that work remains to decriminalize informal recycling and de-stigmatize low-income cyclists in Vancouver.},

This study aims to present a qualitative and quantitative description of the informal sector and its role in the collection of recyclables in Beijing. Via a semi-structured and -quantitative questionnaire survey among informal stakeholders we could ascertain daily individual collection quantities (kg/cap/day), thereby generated revenues and respective trading network and structures (informal recycling value chain) of informal stakeholders. The field survey identified three groups of informal collectors, namely Waste Pickers, Waste Merchants and Middle Men, who on average collect 16, 311, and 890kg of recyclables per day and capita respectively, and achieve turn-over levels of 1200; 2500 and 5250 CNY per month. In order to explain the strong performance of the IS the approach of the old institutional economics has been chosen as analytical tool.},

  abstract = {A systematic and reproducible ``workflow''\textemdash the process that moves a scientific investigation from raw data to coherent research question to insightful contribution\textemdash should be a fundamental part of academic data-intensive research practice. In this paper, we elaborate basic principles of a reproducible data analysis workflow by defining 3 phases: the Explore, Refine, and Produce Phases. Each phase is roughly centered around the audience to whom research decisions, methodologies, and results are being immediately communicated. Importantly, each phase can also give rise to a number of research products beyond traditional academic publications. Where relevant, we draw analogies between design principles and established practice in software development. The guidance provided here is not intended to be a strict rulebook; rather, the suggestions for practices and tools to advance reproducible, sound data-intensive analysis may furnish support for both students new to research and current researchers who are new to data-intensive work.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that literally billions of residents in urban and peri-urban areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America are served by onsite sanitation systems (e.g. various types of latrines and septic tanks). Until recently, the management of faecal sludge from these onsite systems has been grossly neglected, partially as a result of them being considered temporary solutions until sewer-based systems could be implemented. However, the perception of onsite or decentralized sanitation technologies for urban areas is gradually changing, and is increasingly being considered as long-term, sustainable options in urban areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack sewer infrastructures. This is the first book dedicated to faecal sludge management. It compiles the current state of knowledge of the rapidly evolving field of faecal sludge management, and presents an integrated approach that includes technology, management, and planning based on Sandecs 20 years of experience in the field.             Faecal Sludge Management: Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation addresses the organization of the entire faecal sludge management service chain, from the collection and transport of sludge, and the current state of knowledge of treatment options, to the final end use or disposal of treated sludge. The book also presents important factors to consider when evaluating and upscaling new treatment technology options.             The book is designed for undergraduate and graduate students, and engineers and practitioners in the field who have some basic knowledge of environmental and/or wastewater engineering.

  abstract = {Sanitation access in urban areas of low-income countries is provided through unstandardized onsite technologies containing accumulated faecal sludge. The demand for infrastructure to manage faecal sludge is increasing, however, no reliable method exists to estimate total accumulated quantities and qualities (Q\&Q) This proposed approach averages out complexities to estimate conditions at a centralized to semi-centralized scale required for management and treatment technology solutions, as opposed to previous approaches evaluating what happens in individual containments. Empirical data, demographic data, and questionnaires were used in Kampala, Uganda to estimate total faecal sludge accumulation in the city, resulting in 270\,L/cap{$\bullet$}year for pit latrines and 280\,L/cap{$\bullet$}year for septic tanks. Septic tank sludge was more dilute than pit latrine sludge, however, public toilet was not a distinguishing factor. Non-household sources of sludge represent a significant fraction of the total and have different characteristics than household-level sludge. Income level, water connection, black water only, solid waste, number of users, containment volume, emptying frequency, and truck size were predictors of sludge quality. Empirical relationships such as a COD:TS of 1.09\,{$\pm$}\,0.56 could be used for more resource efficient sampling campaigns. Based on this approach, spatially available demographic, technical and environmental (SPA-DET) data and statistical relationships between parameters could be used to predict Q\&Q of faecal sludge.},

The SSI is primarily financed by Viva con Agua and WHH with technical support from Aguaconsult and German Toilet Organisation.  The genesis of this paper was during the kick-off workshop of the SSI, when WHH country teams received orientation to concepts of WASH systems and systems strengthening. Participants remarked on the apparent `water bias' of what was being presented, and the SSI technical team was subsequently tasked to revise the tools and conceptual framework used in the SSI to better address sanitation and hygiene. Indeed, the sentiments from the workshop participants reflect the wider position of those working at WASH systems globally at the time. It was agreed that a discussion paper be developed, not only for the SSI's internal purposes, but also to contribute to the wider sector debate around how to better capture sanitation and hygiene in WASH systems thinking and approaches. This discussion paper reflects the SSI's evolving thinking on this topic, particularly on questions such as: what are key differences between water supply, sanitation and hygiene that may affect approaches to systems strengthening?; are conceptual frameworks and concepts for `WASH' systems fully applicable to all three WASH sub-sectors?; if not, what adaptations are needed?, and; what examples are there of systems strengthening that are specific to sanitation and hygiene?  The paper seeks to prompt and contribute to sector discussions and add to the available documentation on this somewhat neglected topic. It does not aim to be the definitive word on sanitation and hygiene systems strengthening, nor does it seek to prescribe specific concepts and frameworks to the wider sector.},

It is part of a project funded by the Bill \&amp; Melinda Gates (BMGF) through the OPP1164143, untitled ``Characterization of faecal material during drying''. This project was granted for funding after the 5-years Transformative Technologies convening at the BMGF headquarters in 2016, where drying was recognized as a gap in the transformative technologies for the implementation of innovative sanitation technologies.{$<$}br /{$>$} The addendum of data compiles the results from experiments directly related to drying or having indirect implications in the process. The data was obtained from experimental work conducted from 2013 to date, and involving several research institutions. As the addendum of data is an initiative led by the Pollution Research Group at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, most of the data come from this research group. Partner institutions adhered to this initiative and shared their data, including: (i) Swansea University through the SPECIFIC research group; (ii) Cranfield University through their Bioenergy laboratory; (iii) Duke University through their WASH-AID centre; (iv) Laval University through their Civil and Water Engineering department; (v) Victoria University through their Public \&amp; Environmental Engineering laboratory; (vi) Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) through their Sanitation, Water and Solid Waste for Development (SANDEC) department.{$<$}br /{$>$} In the addendum, the data is organized in datasheets that are categorized in different thematics according to the content. In each datasheet, the data is displayed as graphs and includes an interpretation. In addition to this, the datasheets contain the basic information that is required to understand how the data was obtained, including the information about the feedstock, laboratory equipment, experimental conditions and performed analysis. The datasheets also offer the bibliographic references about where the results can be found in literature and the hyperlink to access to the raw files with the data. Moreover, this document includes a background with a landscape about faecal sludge drying, description of the fundamentals aspects from faecal sludge drying to understand better the significance and applicability of the data, and a summary of the analysis from results from the datasheets with their practical implications in the field.{$<$}br /{$>$} The datasheets were categorized into eight groups: thermodynamics, kinetics, physiochemical properties, morphology, mechanical properties, dewaterability, disinfection, gas emission. Different types of faecal samples were involved on the generation of the data: fresh faeces and faecal sludge from various types of onsite sanitation facilities, among which ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines, urine diversion dry toilets (UDDT), anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) from a decentralized wastewater treatment plant (DEWAT).},

  abstract = {Earth has been a traditional building material to construct houses in Africa. One of the most common techniques is the use of sun dried or kiln fired adobe bricks with mud mortar. Fired bricks are the main cause for deforestation in countries like Malawi. Although this technique is low-cost, the bricks vary largely in shape, strength and durability. This leads to weak houses which suffer considerable damage during floods and seismic events. One solution is the use of dry-stack masonry with stabilized interlocking compressed earth blocks (ICEB). This technology has the potential of substituting the current bricks by a more sustainable kind of block. This study was made in the context of the HiLoTec project, which focuses on houses in rural areas of developing countries. For this study, Malawi was chosen for a case study. This paper presents the experimental results of tests made with dry-stack ICEBs. Soil samples from Malawi were taken and studied. Since the experimental campaign could not be carried out in Malawi, a homogenization process of Portuguese soil was made to produce ICEBs at the University of Minho, Portugal. Then, the compression and tensile strength of the materials was determined via small cylinder samples. Subsequently, the compression and flexural strength of units were determined. Finally, tests to determine the compressive strength of both prisms and masonry wallets and to determine the initial shear strength of the dry interfaces were carried out. This work provides valuable data for low-cost eco-efficient housing.},

  abstract = {Plastic recycling is one of the important ways to mitigate plastic pollution. However, chemicals present in recycled plastics is one of the key qualities affecting their potential uses and deserves more attention. 475 migrants coming from 15 postconsumer recycled polyolefins were identified by direct immersion-solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (DI-SPME-GC-MS) and atmospheric pressure-gas chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (APGC-QTOF-MS). About 60 \% of them might not be of human risk because they were food additives/components or they are saturated hydrocarbons, fatty acyls, or prenol lipids. Most of them had molecular weight (MW) between 150 and 210 Da, though, high concern substances with high MW (e.g. octocrylene) implied that high MW surrogates are required to study the efficiency of recycling processes for polyolefins. The mean predicted octanol/water partition coefficient (XLogP) was about 6.5 and 3.5 for 95 \% ethanol and 3 \% acetic acid food simulants, respectively. Octocrylene, 1-tetradecene, 1-dodecene, dodecyl acrylate, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diethyl ester, benzenamine, 2,4-dichloro-, and diethyl phthalate were of high concern depending on the potential food contact use of the materials. The results presented are informative and can be of great help for recyclers and law makers to recycle polyolefins for safe food contact use.},

  abstract = {Biogas digesters could help to reduce deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa by providing a source of energy that would otherwise be provided by woodfuel. However, the link between deforestation and use of woodfuel at global level is weak because fuel is often obtained from fallen wood or from sources felled for construction or land clearance. This paper examines the link between deforestation and use of woodfuel, and evaluates whether biogas digesters are likely to help reduce deforestation in Africa. Woodfuel production and consumption in Africa are increasing over time. Of the deforestation observed in 2010, we estimated that 70({$\pm$}42)\% can be attributed to woodfuel demand. Uncertainties in this figure arise from uncertainty in efficiency of energy use in different designs of wood-burning stoves, and the percentage of energy obtained from woodfuel in rural and urban populations. The contribution of woodfuel demand to deforestation is predicted to increase by 2030 to up to 83({$\pm$}50)\%. This is due to an increasing population requiring more woodfuel and so contributing to a higher proportion of total deforestation. Biogas production has the potential to reduce deforestation due to woodfuel demand by between 6 and 36\% in 2010 and between 4 and 26\% in 2030. This is equivalent to 10\textendash 40\% of total deforestation in 2010, and 9\textendash 35\% of total deforestation in 2030. The highest contribution to biogas production is likely to be from cattle manure, and the uncertainty in the potential of biogas to reduce deforestation is mainly associated with uncertainties in the amount of biogas produced per animal.},

Three essential elements to establishing trust in a work include: trust in the paper, trust in the author, and trust in the data. To address these elements in a systematic and automated way, we propose the ripetaScore as a direct measurement of a paper's research practices, professionalism, and reproducibility.

Despite advancements in technology, however, some three billion people, primarily in the rural areas of developing countries, continue to meet their energy needs for cooking through traditional means by burning biomass resources (i.e., firewood, crop residues and animal dung) in crude traditional stoves. Such practices are known to be the source of significant environmental, social, economic and public health issues. To achieve sustainable development in these regions, it is imperative that access to clean and affordable (renewable) energy is made available. Within this context, upgrading existing biomass resources (i.e., animal manure, crop residues, kitchen waste and green wastes) to cleaner and more efficient energy carriers (such as biogas from anaerobic digestion) has unique potential to provide clean and reliable energy, while simultaneously preserving the local and global environment. In spite of its significant potential to serve developing nations, however, the high costs and lack of expertise in installation and maintenance of biogas technology preclude widespread adoption in geographically isolated communities. Concerted efforts from both governmental and non-governmental sectors are absolutely essential in facilitating modernization and dissemination of biogas technology to harness the inherent potential that is currently underutilized and unexploited. The intent of this paper seeks to highlight the present status, challenges, and potential of biogas technology to advocate for further research, development and dissemination of the concept in developing countries.},

Despite a growing number of papers that compare MNL coefficients, no examples of appropriate tests of the joint and separate hypotheses of scale and parameter equality in MNL models exist in the marketing literature. The purpose of this paper is to address the proper procedure for MNL parameter comparisons between different data sets and to propose a simple relative scaling test that can be implemented with standard MNL estimation software.

  abstract = {Ongoing debates surrounding Open Access to the scholarly literature are multifaceted and complicated by disparate and often polarised viewpoints from engaged stakeholders. At the current stage, Open Access has become such a global issue that it is critical for all involved in scholarly publishing, including policymakers, publishers, research funders, governments, learned societies, librarians, and academic communities, to be well-informed on the history, benefits, and pitfalls of Open Access. In spite of this, there is a general lack of consensus regarding the potential pros and cons of Open Access at multiple levels. This review aims to be a resource for current knowledge on the impacts of Open Access by synthesizing important research in three major areas: academic, economic and societal. While there is clearly much scope for additional research, several key trends are identified, including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly, as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic impact of Open Access is less well-understood, although it is clear that access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises, and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore, Open Access has the potential to save both publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources, and can provide some economic benefits to traditionally subscription-based journals. The societal impact of Open Access is strong, in particular for advancing citizen science initiatives, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries. Open Access supersedes all potential alternative modes of access to the scholarly literature through enabling unrestricted re-use, and long-term stability independent of financial constraints of traditional publishers that impede knowledge sharing. However, Open Access has the potential to become unsustainable for research communities if high-cost options are allowed to continue to prevail in a widely unregulated scholarly publishing market. Open Access remains only one of the multiple challenges that the scholarly publishing system is currently facing. Yet, it provides one foundation for increasing engagement with researchers regarding ethical standards of publishing and the broader implications of 'Open Research'.},

  abstract = {Peer review is embedded in the core of our knowledge generation systems, perceived as a method for establishing quality or scholarly legitimacy for research, while also often distributing academic prestige and standing on individuals. Despite its critical importance, it curiously remains poorly understood in a number of dimensions. In order to address this, we have analysed peer review to assess where the major gaps in our theoretical and empirical understanding of it lie. We identify core themes including editorial responsibility, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, the function and quality of peer review, and the social and epistemic implications of peer review. The high-priority gaps are focused around increased accountability and justification in decision-making processes for editors and developing a deeper, empirical understanding of the social impact of peer review. Addressing this at the bare minimum will require the design of a consensus for a minimal set of standards for what constitutes peer review, and the development of a shared data infrastructure to support this. Such a field requires sustained funding and commitment from publishers and research funders, who both have a commitment to uphold the integrity of the published scholarly record. We use this to present a guide for the future of peer review, and the development of a new research discipline based on the study of peer review.},

  abstract = {The net volume of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in Himachal Pradesh is 350 tons per day (TPD) with an annual growth rate varying between 1 and 1.33\%. This leads to serious considerations regarding potential occupational health hazards of workers associated with MSW. The study generated from non-engineered landfill sites was carried out at three locations- Shimla, Solan, and Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, India. . The main aim of this study was to determine existing occupational hazards in relation to MSW management at these locations, to coordinate with the different municipalities and suggest suitable remedial measures for our study locations. In particular, the exposure assessment to the work force comprising of street sweeping, waste collection, waste processing, and rag picking were assessed using an interview scheduling technique. A questionnaire survey was carried out on these workers with the questions asked related to their work culture, socio-economic conditions, general awareness of occupational health risks and related occupational health hazards associated with the work being performed by them. The results showed that the workforce mainly comprised of males with a low percentage of literacy rates. The age distribution showed that majority of waste collectors and street sweepers were above 30\,years of age (67\%) and that the rag pickers in Mandi town were below 20\,years of age. Income variation between casual and regular workers was highly significant with regular workers (INR 600\textendash 1200; USD 9\textendash 18) getting almost six times the payment of the casual workers (INR 100\textendash 200; USD 3\textendash 7.5). From the studies conducted the study deduced that about 64\% of waste collectors, 80\% of street sweepers and 10\% of rag pickers in Solan and about 6.67\% street sweepers, 57.47\% waste collectors and 100\% of rag pickers in Mandi were not provided with any protective equipment. Interestingly, in the capital city of Shimla a small fraction of the street sweepers (28\%) and waste collector (6\%) confirmed that they were given protective equipment twice in a year. The lack of provisions of protective equipment along with the ignorance of the workers results in occupational health hazards due to different types of external injuries. The major occupational health issues reported by various categories of waste workers were muscle and ligament sprain, cuts and lacerations and different allergies varying between 1.97 and 66.67\% [ for e.g. in Solan it varies from 32.47\textendash 66.67\%; Shimla 1.97\textendash 10.16\% and in Mandi 9.52\textendash 16.67\%], 6.36\textendash 67.95\% and 5.77\textendash 42.86\%, respectively. From this study, it was observed that such workers are ill-protected against such occupational health hazards new laws and policies are needed to be introduced for their protection.},

  abstract = {In Uganda, the municipal solid wastes are generally a menace to the environment, ranging from indiscriminate dumping, open burning, and landfills, which would be utilized to augment agricul\- tural fields through organic manure. The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) of Uganda, however from 2009 to 2012 initiated and implemented a Clean Development Mechanism project. This project was established and conducted in nine urban centers with the key objective of reducing methane and other environmental nuisances while generating compost manure. The incoming fresh municipal wastes at composting facilities were sorted into six categories; i) wood and wood products, ii) food and food wastes, iii) textiles, iv) garden, yard and park wastes, v) paper and pulp, and vi) glass, plastics, and metals. These were laboratory analyzed based on standard procedures, characterized and investigated for the pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) (g kg-1). Statistical analyses were performed based on One-Way ANOVA, implemented in the SPSS program. The results indicate that the municipal fresh solid wastes were mainly dominated by biodegradable organic matter; garden, yard, and park wastes (49\%), food and food wastes (43.2\%), and the other wastes falling below 5.4\%. Overall, the pH was 7.7 {$\pm$} 0.02, TOC 318.2 {$\pm$} 2.90, TN 12.1 {$\pm$} 0.10, C/N 26.7 {$\pm$} 0.20, P 4.4 {$\pm$} 0.04, K 35.0 {$\pm$} 0.49, Ca 38.9 {$\pm$} 0.51, and Mg 5.8 {$\pm$} 0.09. The concentration of the fresh wastes and macro-nutrients varied per municipality and were congruent with the economic activities and population lifestyles. We detected the effect of season/month on the concentration of wastes which corresponded with the various agronomical activities. The results from this study suggest that the notion of composting is potentially a viable organic waste management strategy in the country which can ultimately generate sufficient organic manure for agricultural input and thus enhanced carbon sequestration.},

An average of 62\% of phosphorus could be removed in the form of struvite when magnesium was added to the urine solution after ureolysis had forced the precipitation of calcium and magnesium minerals. Dilution and the presence of faecal urease were found to affect the rate of ureolysis but not the purity of the struvite recovered. These results indicate that, by simply storing urine until it achieves a pH of 8 or greater, struvite can be recovered from source-separated urine with only a magnesium addition.},

The town of Siddhipur in the Kathmandu valley was selected as a study site to determine the feasibility of establishing a community-scale struvite processing centre using source-separated urine as a feedstock. Focus groups, workshops and household questionnaires were used to determine cultural acceptability and willingness to pay. Urine quality and quantity measurements, along with fertilizer cost analysis were used to determine the economic feasibility. A regression analysis using the current, local value of the nutrients was used to calculate the theoretical value of struvite; the estimated nutrient value of struvite was found to be 24 to 41 NRp per kilogram, which is in the same range as locally available Diammonium Phosphate (DAP). The production of struvite would currently cost about 25 NRp/kg due to high prices of available magnesium sources. Nevertheless, struvite precipitation can be economically feasible for at least three reasons. First, Nepal possesses its own magnesite deposits, which might allow it to produce cheaper magnesium sources. Second, customers are likely to pay more for locally produced struvite than for imported synthetic fertilizers. Third, the effluent from struvite precipitation can also be used as a valuable and efficient nitrogen and potassium fertilizer. Despite shadow-pricing based on the constituent nutrients, the true value of struvite can not be known until it is produced and sold.},

  abstract = {The cost-effectiveness of two different urine-collection programs in South Africa are modelled over a range of parameters and are interpreted from the perspective of both the municipality and the community.           ,              As the number of technologies and programming approaches for improving global sanitation grows, there is an increasing need to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each so that policy can be driven by informed decisions that consider cost as well as impact. I use data from two different urine-collection programs that were implemented in rural South Africa to model the cost-effectiveness of each in terms of the cost per litre of urine collected and the cost per household, over a range of operational values. One program was based on conditional cash transfers with the aim of increasing toilet use, while the second program was centrally managed and designed to be logistically simple for the municipality. In comparing the results of the two models I find a paradox. Urine that is collected from households by the municipality is less expensive than incentivized urine collection on both a volumetric and household basis, but only at urine collection rates that cannot be achieved without incentives. Conversely, the incentivized collection is more cost effective when the collection rates are low, but at rates that would correspond to very low incentive prices, rendering the incentive scheme useless. My results illustrate the importance of cost-effectiveness analysis as a tool in sanitation programming but I also highlight the need to view the data with a more nuanced approach that considers the complexities of program implementation in poor, rural communities as the mathematical optimal may not correspond to a realistic, or socially desirable one.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to discuss the role of networks formed of waste-picker cooperatives in ameliorating problems of final disposal of solid waste in the city of Rio de Janeiro, since the city's main landfill will soon have to close because of exhausted capacity. However, it is estimated that in the city of Rio de Janeiro there are around five thousand waste-pickers working in poor conditions, with lack of physical infrastructure and training, but contributing significantly by diverting solid waste from landfills. According to the Sustainable Development Indicators (IBGE, 2010a, IBGE, 2010b) in Brazil, recycling rates hover between 45\% and 55\%. In the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, only 1\% of the waste produced is collected selectively by the government (COMLURB, 2010), demonstrating that recycling is mainly performed by waste-pickers. Furthermore, since the recycling market is an oligopsony that requires economies of scale to negotiate directly with industries, the idea of working in networks of cooperatives meets the demands for joint marketing of recyclable materials. Thus, this work presents a method for creating and structuring a network of recycling cooperatives, with prior training for working in networks, so that the expected synergies and joint efforts can lead to concrete results. We intend to demonstrate that it is first essential to strengthen the waste-pickers' cooperatives in terms of infrastructure, governance and training so that solid waste management can be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable in the city of Rio de Janeiro.},

  abstract = {Biomass burning (BB) is a significant source of atmospheric particles in many parts of the world. Whereas many studies have demonstrated the importance of BB emissions in central and northern Europe, especially in rural areas, its impact in urban air quality of southern European countries has been sparsely investigated. In this study, highly time resolved multi-wavelength absorption coefficients together with levoglucosan (BB tracer) mass concentrations were combined to apportion carbonaceous aerosol sources. The Aethalometer model takes advantage of the different spectral behavior of BB and fossil fuel (FF) combustion aerosols. The model was found to be more sensitive to the assumed value of the aerosol \AA ngstr\"om exponent (AAE) for FF (AAEff) than to the AAE for BB (AAEbb). As result of various sensitivity tests the model was optimized with AAEff=1.1 and AAEbb=2. The Aethalometer model and levoglucosan tracer estimates were in good agreement. The Aethalometer model was further applied to data from three sites in Granada urban area to evaluate the spatial variation of CMff and CMbb (carbonaceous matter from FF or BB origin, respectively) concentrations within the city. The results showed that CMbb was lower in the city centre while it has an unexpected profound impact on the CM levels measured in the suburbs (about 40\%). Analysis of BB tracers with respect to wind speed suggested that BB was dominated by sources outside the city, to the west in a rural area. Distinguishing whether it corresponds to agricultural waste burning or with biomass burning for domestic heating was not possible. This study also shows that although traffic restrictions measures contribute to reduce carbonaceous concentrations, the extent of the reduction is very local. Other sources such as BB, which can contribute to CM as much as traffic emissions, should be targeted to reduce air pollution.},

Specifically, we cluster the descriptions of \textasciitilde 3.2 million aid activities conducted between 2000 and 2019 totalling US\$2.8 trillion. As a result, we generated 173 activity clusters representing the topics of underlying aid activities. Among them, 70 activity clusters cover topics that have not yet been analysed empirically (for example, greenhouse gas emissions reduction and maternal health care). On the basis of our activity clusters, global development aid can be monitored for new topics and at new levels of granularity, allowing the identification of unexplored spatio-temporal disparities. Our framework can be adopted by development finance and policy institutions to promote evidence-based decisions targeting the SDGs.},

High consumption has made plastic one of the most important municipal solid waste compounds, the quantity of which has increased in recent decades. Plastic solid wastes are known as a threat to the environment, and its efficient management in various aspects such as cost\textendash benefit requires decision-making tools. This study was assessing the cost\textendash benefit of plastic solid waste management by development of an economic model, and definition of different scenarios to change plastic solid waste management status. The results showed that 8971 tons of plastic solid waste were generated annually in the studied city. The plastic solid wastes were finally transferred to either recycling or landfilling site through 5 identified routes. 83 percent of the total recycled plastic solid waste was due to post-separation routes, and only 7.7 percent of the total plastic solid waste was recycled from the source separation route. The economic comparison of scenarios showed that with the aggregation of post-separation routes, the net revenue of plastic solid waste management increases by 334,000 euro per year while increasing the public participation and the ratio of source separation route raises net revenue by 875,000 euro per year, which was the best economic condition among the scenarios. Using life cycle cost method and it's respected developed economic model truly satisfied the conditions of both, the current plastic solid waste management and the alternative scenarios, and hence can be adopted as a tool for decision-making.}

Decision makers therefore can benefit from systematic approaches to evaluate different waste management options considering multiple sustainability criteria. This study reviews multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches that assess the sustainability of waste management systems. We present a framework for integrating LCA-MCDM approaches. First, we identified the most used MCDM methods for waste management systems published in the literature and highlight the technical and sustainability criteria used in the literature. Then, key issues in LCA studies of waste management systems were reviewed and discussed. The review results indicated that there are only a limited number of studies that integrated LCA and MCDM to assess the sustainability of waste management systems. Furthermore, more than half of the studies that did use the integrated approach failed to consider all three pillars of sustainability. There is also a lack of detailed information on the life cycle inventory used for the LCA part which reduces the reproducibility and clarity of the studies. In addition, the normalization and weighting methods to convert environmental impact categories for each scenario into single scores were often neither clearly explained nor justified. Also, the detailed information about experts involved in the decision-making process as well as the procedure of acquiring their opinions were not fully presented. Finally, the LCA and MCDM approaches, relevant sustainability criteria and related standards were used to present a set of recommendations for performing an integrated LCA-MCDM study that ensure scientifically robust, meaningful and reliable decisions.},

  abstract = {Choice ProbabilitiesMixed logit is a highly flexible model that can approximate any random utility model (McFadden \&amp; Train, 2000). It obviates the three limitations of standard logit by allowing for random taste variation, unrestricted substitution patterns, and correlation in unobserved factors over time. Unlike probit, it is not restricted to normal distributions. Its derivation is straightforward, and simulation of its choice probabilities is computationally simple.Like probit, the mixed logit model has been known for many years but has only become fully applicable since the advent of simulation. The first application of mixed logit was apparently the automobile demand models created jointly by Boyd \&amp; Mellman (1980) and Cardell \&amp; Dunbar (1980). In these studies, the explanatory variables did not vary over decision makers, and the observed dependent variable was market shares rather than individual customers' choices. As a result, the computationally intensive integration that is inherent in mixed logit (as explained later) needed to be performed only once for the market as a whole, rather than for each decision maker in a sample. Early applications on customer-level data, such as Train et al. (1987a) and Ben-Akiva et al. (1993), included only one or two dimensions of integration, which could be calculated by quadrature. Improvements in computer speed and in our understanding of simulation methods have allowed the full power of mixed logits to be utilized. Among the studies to evidence this power are those by Bhat (1998a) and Brownstone \&amp; Train (1999) on cross-sectional data, and Erdem (1996), Revelt \&amp; Train (1998), and Bhat (2000) on panel data.},

  abstract = {E-waste management in Vietnam poses real challenges such as the lack of specific e-waste legislation, the strong involvement of ``craft villages'' and the missing of monitoring data. Many issues (e.g., pollution level, generated waste, health of workers and resident living at recycling sites) lead to the limited access to these craft villages. Thus, there is no comprehensive picture on e-waste management in Vietnam available today. This research focuses on the current situation of e-waste management. Sources of e-waste, collection and treatment in Vietnam are investigated by utilizing most available sources of information (published journals, unpublished works from projects and reports from institutes, ministry) together with the interviewed data from experts, collectors, workers and especially, biggest traders in the field. Based on this information, the processes applied in Vietnam, both in the formal and informal sector, have been analyzed systematically in terms of inputs, outputs, potential emissions and related risks for workers. From these aspects, a comparison in terms of legal frameworks, collection and treatment at both formal and informal sector between Vietnam and other countries in Asian region was undertaken. Thus, major challenges of e-waste management and relatively comprehensive image of e-waste management and treatment in Vietnam have been identified.}

Through a participatory action research approach, four PVs were co-produced and a collaborative research design was developed with participants to use the videos as a communication tool for enhancing dialogue and promoting inclusive and integrated approaches to waste management with policy makers. The catadore/as (`recyclers') involved are all participants of the Participatory Sustainable Waste Management (PSWM) project, a six-year partnership programme between the University of Victoria, the University of S\~ao Paulo, over 30 recycling cooperatives, municipal governments and various non-governmental organisations in the metropolitan region of S\~ao Paulo. This paper explores the methodological and theoretical contributions of using PV for enhancing the representation of catadore/as and the potential for shifting power dynamics in spaces of public policy. It also points to the growing organisation (and movement) of recycling cooperatives and associations as instrumental in improving the livelihoods of recyclers and crucial to expanding models of PSWM. The key findings highlight: the importance of building strong partnerships between the government and the recyclers; the necessary expansion of environmental education programmes valuing the principles of PSWM; and the need for adequate public policies to support these initiatives. The paper also draws attention to the relationship of power and knowledge that emerged through this process and reflects on the changing nature of citizen engagement in policy processes.}

The team chose to focus on those projects recognized as successes to obtain a reasonable representation of the better practices in sanitation programs. The study identified a number of useful examples and tentative lessons about finance which should help to advance the design of sanitation finance at the outset of a project. Replicating such experiences will require a better understanding of what drives household investment and what the key constraints limiting such investment are, in both financial and non-financial terms. The sanitation challenge continues to grow with population, as does the cost of failing to meet it. This study is a worthwhile contribution to addressing the challenge of how to pay for sanitation.},

The use of renewable energy has the potential to increase access to electricity especially in the rural areas. There are several regulatory instruments that are being used to increase access to renewable energy and to influence the adoption of renewable energy technologies in the country. Renewable energy use in the country makes up a small portion of the total primary energy mix. Adoption of renewable energy technologies by the private sector could add to the renewable energy component of the country?s energy mix. The research conducted used a case study strategy where data was collected from small and medium poultry farms that are similar in operation. The study looked into issues of awareness and learning as well as application of renewable energy technology in the industry and how they relate to adoption and diffusion of the technology. The study was an in depth study of the factors that can drive adoption and diffusion of solar energy technology in this sector. Results show that there are opportunities to use existing platforms for knowledge sharing on renewable energy technology through associations, media and demonstration projects where renewable energy technology is applied to different agricultural practices. On the other hand, the cost of renewable energy technology such as solar equipment is costly especially for poultry businesses that are growing.},

Implementation projects have been conducted worldwide, but have frequently faced very low success rates. Different demographic and socio-economic factors have been analysed to explain low rates but there are almost no studies that try to understand, from the users' perspective, the factors involved when choosing among different cooking technologies. Through a qualitative methodological approach we documented the adoption of improved cookstoves through the implementation programme of a Mexican NGO. Results showed that although the programme raised public awareness, the improved cookstoves did not reach the poorest sector. The socioeconomic level was found positively correlated with the adoption of the improved cookstoves, but neither the age nor the educational levels were. Payment of the stove did not seem to be an adoption factor. Differences among individual users were more significant than differences between communities. Finally as men are the principal fuelwood harvesters, they should be considered as an important group in diffusion programs.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the electronic waste management practices such as generation, storage, collection, transportation and disposal in Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality. This was achieved through questionnaires distributed to residents in Namakgale and Phalaborwa residential areas, structured interviews with municipal workers under the Environmental Health Division and observation in the landfill site and collection points were also used in gathering information on the electronic waste management. In the study it was found that a wide range of electronic waste is generated and lighting equipment, small household equipment and ICT equipment are disposed of in large numbers in the study area. The municipality is responsible for waste management in the study area. Electronic waste generated is stored, collected and disposed together with all other domestic waste in the area. No segregation or recycling at household level was evident. It was also found that the municipality does not have a formal relationship with electronic waste recycling companies to eliminate the flow of electronic waste from households to the landfill site. A lack of own regulatory and by-laws on electronic waste was noted and seemed to be one of the challenges the municipality is facing. The findings highlighted the low level of community awareness regarding electronic waste. The study concluded that there is a lack or absence of good management of electronic waste storage, collection, transportation in the Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality. From the study, it is recommended that there is a need for meaningful community awareness, environmental education, formulation of by-laws and formal recycling projects for effective electronic waste in Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality.},

The choice of the city of Taranto is due both to the significant magnitude of the ascertained debt, which was one of the highest in the history of Italy, and to the considerable economic effects caused by the recovery procedure. Specifically, have been firstly examined the reasons which led to the collapse of the local public authority and the main aspects characterizing the administrative management of the passive mass besides the possible solutions for the definitive implementation of the recovery plan.}

  abstract = {This is the draft of a chapter from a forthcoming book related to the conference Sensing Change: Mapping the Climatic Imaginary through Art, Science and History, held at the Chemical Heritage Foundation November 7-9, 2013. The artwork shown in the exhibit Sensing Change is part of a thriving environmental art movement. There is a long history of art influencing environmental attitudes and to some extent behavior. Historically such art has used what photography critic Vicki Goldberg calls the "pastoral eulogy" approach but there is also a more critical approach that emphasizes the environmental damage and risk associated with human behavior. Ecological artist Ruth Wallen says, "Ecological art work can help engender an intuitive appreciation of the environment, address core values, advocate political action, and broaden intellectual understanding." But there is little evidence about whether people change their behavior in response to this sort of art. This chapter uses a contingent choice survey (a kind of choice experiment) to investigate whether exposure to such artwork influences environmental behavior, in particular the purchase of carbon offsets. (Purchasing offsets provides funding for activities that reduce net greenhouse gas emissions.) Contingent choice surveys are often used to analyze respondents\^a\texteuro\texttrademark{} environmental behavior and/or the underlying preferences for environmental goods and resources driving that behavior. In these surveys, respondents choose among a selection of hypothetical or real scenarios comprised of varying levels of different variables. Based on the choices they make, the relative importance of the different variables can be estimated. In the survey upon which this chapter is based, respondents chose from alternative carbon offset purchase options, including the option to buy no offsets. The central questions are as follows: what would make respondents more or less likely to choose to buy no offsets, and did respondents who saw artwork as part of the survey differ systematically from those who didn\^a\texteuro\texttrademark t? Subsets of respondents in a choice experiment investigating willingness to buy carbon offsets were shown artistic images related to climate change. One subset was shown photographs from The Canary Project (Susannah Sayler and Edward Morris); another subset was shown images from the Wind Map: Poetry in Motion project (Fernanda Vi\~A\textcopyright gas and Martin Wattenberg); a control group was not shown any artistic images. The survey responses were analyzed to explore whether the artistic images affected respondents' willingness to buy carbon offsets. Another issue investigated was whether the images affect the ways in which the willingness to buy carbon offsets is influenced by other factors. These other factors include the types of mitigation efforts being funded by offsets and also personal characteristics of the respondents such as age, income, and adherence to social norms. The results of the split-sample contingent choice survey indicate that respondents who were shown photographs by the Canary Project that illustrate the impacts of climate change were more likely to purchase carbon offsets than were respondents in a control group. This is even though the respondents viewed the images only briefly: typically for less than a minute. Not all artistic images had this effect, though: respondents who saw animated images from the Wind Map Project that illustrate wind speeds and patterns for extreme weather events were actually less willing to buy offsets than the control group. Results indicate that preferences about buying carbon offsets are very heterogeneous, but in all cases the pattern remains that respondents in the treatment group that saw the Canary Project photos are more likely to buy offsets and respondents in the treatment group that saw the Wind Map Project images are less likely to buy offsets. The heterogeneity was driven largely by variables related to social norms and expectations. But the differences across treatment groups were not driven by differences in individual characteristics. The chapter continues with some thoughts about why the responses to the Canary Project and Wind Map Project art differed. The chapter concludes with some ideas for future survey-based research exploring the impact of art on environmental attitudes and behavior.},

However, this led to a backlash from the business community, which argued in court that the ban would lead to economic costs and job losses, following which Malawi stopped implementing the Environment Management (Plastics) Regulations of 2015 in accordance with a court order. Meanwhile, the Government of Malawi has signed and committed to the new United Nations Environment Assembly resolution on addressing single-use plastic products pollution. The country is now reconsidering its policies on plastics. This paper summarises the case for banning single-use plastics in Malawi, based on available information from Malawi as well as research and experience from Africa and the rest of the world.

Millions of informal recyclers (or waste pickers) are not recognized by the government and little has been done to improve their livelihoods and health status; Mongolia is not the exception. Today there is very little information on the assets and vulnerabilities of informal recyclers in Mongolia. This research seeks to fill this gap. We apply a rapid livelihood assessment using a mixed methods approach (structured questionnaire survey, key informant interviews, focus group discussions) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Beyond assessing the social, economic and environmental situation of local informal recyclers, the research seeks to also provide some recommendations for improving their lives. The results have shown that the majority of this population in Mongolia is challenged by several factors such as homelessness, extreme cold weather and no official identity document (ID card). Unemployment and lack of external support for recycling activities, social isolation, discrimination and alcohol addiction are additional frequent predicaments of this population. Two-thirds of the informal recyclers experience various occupational health hazards including stomach diseases, skin diseases, kidney and liver problems, back pain, cuts, burns, and fractured bones. We recommend that public policies address the livelihood issues of these informal recyclers and further stimulate their organization, maybe into recycling groups, associations or co-operatives, for the purpose of collective empowerment. This can have positive spin-offs to reduce occupational health hazards and to conduct the work more effectively, ultimately benefiting the city environment.},

Due to their small sizes ({$\leq$}5~mm) microplastic particles can be discharged to the environment from treated wastewater effluents. As microplastics have polluted most of our aquatic ecosystems, often finding its way into drinking water, there is urgent need to find new solutions for tackling the menace of microplastic pollution. In this work, sustainable green photocatalytic removal of microplastics from water activated by visible light is proposed as a tool for the removal of microplastics from water. We propose a novel strategy for the elimination of microplastics using glass fiber substrates to trap low density microplastic particles such as polypropylene (PP) which in parallel support the photocatalyst material. Photocatalytic degradation of PP microplastics spherical particles suspended in water by visible light irradiation of zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) immobilized onto glass fibers substrates in a flow through system is demonstrated. Upon irradiation of PP microplastics for two weeks under visible light reduced led to a reduction of the average particle volume by 65\%. The major photodegradation by-products were identified using GC/MS and found to be molecules that are considered to be mostly nontoxic in the literature.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT There are stark differences between the waste recycling literature from the global North and that from the global South. The literature from the global North tends to focus on empirical analyses of existing municipal recycling services and rarely considers institutional factors. When it does, the theoretical approaches adopted are limited, especially regarding the role of informal institutions. In contrast, recycling literature from the global South does focus on informal institutions, but it does so by concentrating on the struggles of waste pickers rather than on the performance of waste management services provided by local authorities. This divergence in the literature suggests the need for an analytical framework that integrates institutions and recycling performance. This article analyses waste disposal regimes in two Latin American metropolitan areas, Medell\'in (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile), and explores the link between income inequality and recycling. It focuses on the political settlements that lie at the heart of the waste regimes. As such, waste regimes in these two cities are understood to be a product of the interplay of balances of power, institutions and distribution of benefits. The study also highlights the need to understand informal institutions as relational phenomena that affect both the rich and the poor, and not just as a subsistence strategy by the latter.},

The methodology used for processing the scientific literature was content analysis, using the google scholar search engine. The main keywords used were RL and PW. This article is divided into two parts: the first part discusses the development of circular economy models and RL networks and raises the conceptual framework of the research, and the second part presents mathematical models and exploratory studies, proposed as a solution for RL problems of PW. Articles published between years 2014 and 2019 were reviewed. In total, 102 references were used, 70 of them are part of the literature review. According to our findings, we can state that the most widely used solution method for mathematical modeling is mixed-integer linear programming, and for exploratory studies, it was evaluations. About 93\% of studies evaluated raw materials related to PW; only 13\% of studies had models with stochastic processes; and 88\% of the investigations used continuous variables, being the multiobjective functions one of the most used to provide solutions to RL problems. Regarding the mathematical models, 49\% were evaluations, 9\% corresponded to multicriteria analysis, 29\% to linear and nonlinear programming, and 4\% to another type of evaluation or model.},

  abstract = {Plastics are part and parcel of the life of human beings. Plastic waste production has increased exponentially over the years with increased use of plastics in every field possible, but its management techniques are yet developing. The statistics indicate the shift of global leaders of plastic production industry from Europe to China in the last decade. Although the plastic waste production per capita is high in the developed countries, so is the efficiency in the management. Countries like China, India, and other low and middle-income countries produce waste in large quantities pertaining to their huge population and are very inefficient in its management. Plastic waste management can be primarily categorized into mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling (FR), incineration, and landfilling. Mechanical recycling involves the recovery of products without significant changeover of its molecular structure or its physical properties and to be reused for a similar purpose. It can be applied to all the types of plastics. FR involves structural and molecular level changes to the plastic and conversion to its raw material or feed material to be used in a different application. Depending on the process and its parameters, it can be pyrolysis, gasification that can be modified according to the product properties and proportion required. Waste to energy involves the conversion of matter to energy and can be done with minimal presorting and cleaning. The problems of air pollution and residual ash management are to be dealt with separately. Landfilling is the least preferable option and is only better than unsanitary disposal in the waste dumps. It consumes land and environmentally is not sustainable. This chapter deals with the types of plastics and their properties, plastic production industry, plastic waste generation statistics, compares the different types of plastic waste management techniques economically and environmentally, and global prospects of plastic in the future.},

Although counterintuitive, it is shown that such a technology could sort clean flakes from rigid packaging waste into a very large number of different plastic grades with modest sorter capacity, provided that the chosen sensor is able to differentiate correctly between any two grades of plastics in the waste. Tests with high-resolution NIR on single pixels of transparent flakes from different types and brands of packaging show that this is indeed the case for a selection of 20 different packaging items bought from shops. Moreover, the results seem to indicate, in line with previous research, that high-resolution NIR data can be linked to important physical plastic properties like the melt flow viscosity and tensile strength. The attraction of deep sorting of waste plastics with relatively cheap sensors and modest sorter capacity is that the present industrial practice of tuning plastic grades to specific applications could coexist with commercial high-grade recycling at high levels of circularity and low carbon footprint. Therefore, advanced recycling technology is likely to be a societal alternative to phasing out plastics for rigid applications.},

However, most developing countries including Thailand have been facing with lack of recycling facilities and low level of source separation practice. By employing questionnaire surveys, this study investigated Bangkok residents' source separation intention and willingness to pay (WTP) for improving MSW service and recycling facilities (n~=~1076). This research extended the theory of planned behavior to explore the effects of both internal and external factors. The survey highlighted perceived inconvenience and mistrust on MSW collection being major barriers to carrying out source separation in Bangkok. Promoting source separation at workplace may possibly create spill-over effect to people's intention to recycle their waste at home. Both subjective norms and knowledge on MSW situation were found to be a positive correlation with Bangkok residents' source separation intention and WTP (p~{$<~$}0.001). Besides, the average WTP values are higher than the existing rate of waste collection service, which shows that Bangkok residents have preference for recycling programs. However, the WTP figures are still much lower than the average MSW management cost. These findings suggest that Bangkok Metropolitan Administration targets improving people knowledge on waste problems that could have adverse impact on the economy and well-being of Bangkok residents and improve its MSW collection service as these factors have positive influence on residents' WTP.},

This research presents an estimation of AHP in municipal waste, and it also reviews and discusses waste management options, available treatments at bench, pilot or full scale, and life cycle assessments (LCAs) available in the literature. Municipal waste of countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development contains on average 2.7\% of baby nappies, 4.8\% of adult nappies and 0.5\% of sanitary pads (in weight), whereas that of Latin-American countries have 7.3\%, 3.3\%, and 0.9\%, respectively. Management options for AHP waste in developed countries are landfilling and incineration, while in developing countries AHP are disposed of in dumpsites and landfills. Most LCAs identify significant environmental impacts in the production of raw materials, while EoL scenarios involving incineration and landfill were found to have a significant contribution to global warming potential. Substitution with alternative products has been suggested as a way of decreasing environmental impacts; however, their use frequently causes a trade-off on different impact categories. Municipalities could use a wide range of policy tools, such as extended producer responsibility systems, bans, levies, ecolabelling, or a combination of these, to reduce the environmental and economic burden of AHP waste.},

One of the main self-management strategies adopted by 2 billion people who have no waste collection service, is to burn their discarded plastic in open, uncontrolled fires. While this strategy provides many benefits, including mass and volume reduction, it is a form of plastic pollution that results in the release of chemical substances and particles that may pose serious risks to public health and the environment. We followed adapted PRISMA guidelines to select and review 20 publications that provide evidence on potential harm to human health from open burning plastic waste, arranging evidence into eight groups of substance emissions: brominated flame retardants; phthalates; potentially toxic elements; dioxins and related compounds; bisphenol A; particulate matter; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We semiquantitatively assessed 18 hazard\textendash pathway\textendash receptor combination scenarios to provide an indication of the relative harm of these emissions so that they could be ranked, compared and considered in future research agenda. This assessment overwhelmingly indicated a high risk of harm to waste pickers, a large group of 11 million informal entrepreneurs who work closely with waste, delivering a circular economy but often without protective equipment or a structured, safe system of work. Though the risk to human health from open burning emissions is high, this remains a substantially under-researched topic.},

Interventions should target three aspects of the pollution: reducing barriers to collection, improving the revenue from the materials and wider informal recycler remuneration, and increasing the quality of the materials. Done well, these interventions will increase the collection rate, reduce pollution from plastics, and help millions of people escape poverty. They present a scalable international solution to a global challenge; and are likely the only viable solution to the widespread lack of solid waste services and infrastructure across low- and middle-income countries.},

There is considerable evidence that the IRS can be empowered to provide affordable, high-quality collection and sorting services (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866#bib27}{Velis, 2017},~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866#bib29}{Velis et al., 2012}). We also acknowledge the considerable challenges around marginalization, exploitation, abuse, child labor, and reduced community health due to picking from dumpsites and working without any personal protective equipment (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866#bib5}{Cook and Velis, 2021},~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866#bib27}{Velis, 2017},~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866#bib28}{Velis and Cook, 2021},~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866#bib29}{Velis et al., 2012}). However, with appropriate economics in place, organized services (such as cooperatives, associations or community-based organizations) can be deployed at scale to capture a sizable proportion of plastics that are mechanically recyclable. Legitimization and wider inclusion of the IRS has been applied extensively across Latin America, with tools currently available to assist with such processes (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866#bib23}{The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2017},~\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866#bib29}{Velis et al., 2012}). This approach has resulted in reduced poverty and enhanced societal inclusion for organized IRS, where employed.},

  abstract = {Faecal sludge management is recognized globally as an essential component of city-wide inclusive sanitation. However, a major gap in developing appropriate and adequate management and monitoring for faecal sludge is the ability to understand and predict the characteristics and volumes of accumulated faecal sludge, and correlations to source populations. Since standard methods for sampling and analysing faecal sludge do not currently exist, results are not comparable, the actual variability is not yet fully understood, and the transfer of knowledge and data between different regions and institutions can be challenging and often arbitrary. Due to this lack of standard analytical methods for faecal sludge, methods from other fields, such as wastewater management, and soil and food science are frequently applied. However, these methods are not necessarily the most suitable for faecal sludge analysis, and have not been specifically adapted for this purpose. Characteristics of faecal sludge can be different than these other matrices by orders of magnitude. There is also a lack of standard methods for sampling, which is complicated by the difficult nature of in situ sampling, the wide range of onsite sanitation technologies and potential sampling locations, and the diverse heterogeneity of faecal sludge within onsite containments and within cities. This illustrates the urgent need to establish common methods and procedures for faecal sludge characterisation, quantification, sampling, and modelling. The aim of this book is to provide a basis for standardised methods for the analysis of faecal sludge from onsite sanitation technologies, for improved communication between sanitation practitioners, and for greater confidence in the generated data. The book presents background information on types of faecal sludge, methods for sample collection, health and safety procedures for handling, case studies of experimental design, an approach for estimating faecal sludge at community to city-wide scales, modelling containment and treatment processes, recipes for simulants, and laboratory methods for faecal sludge analysis currently in use by faecal sludge laboratories. This book will be beneficial for researchers, laboratory technicians, academics, students and sanitation practitioners.},

Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the effect of ignoring starting point bias depends on the bid design and on the true distribution of WTP. A well-balanced, symmetric bid design may result in very modest biases even when the anchoring mechanism is very strong. The power of bid set dummies in detecting starting point bias is low. They tend to account for misspecifications in the distribution assumed by the researcher for the latent WTP, rather than capturing the presence of starting point bias.},

I founded an organization to systematically collect and synthesize impact evaluation results on a wide variety of interventions in development. These data allow me to answer this and other questions across a wide variety of interventions. I examine whether results predict each other and whether variance in results can be explained by program characteristics, such as who is implementing them, where they are being implemented, the scale of the program, and what methods are used. I find that when regressing an estimate on the hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis result formed from all other studies on the same interventionoutcome combination, the result is significant with a coefficient of 0.6-0.7, though the R2 is very low. The program implementer is the main source of heterogeneity in results, with government-implemented programs faring worse than and being poorly predicted by the smaller studies typically implemented by academic/NGO research teams, even controlling for sample size. I then turn to examine specification searching and publication bias, issues which could affect generalizability and are also important for research credibility. I demonstrate that these biases are quite small; nevertheless, to address them, I discuss a mathematical correction that could be applied before showing that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are less prone to this type of bias and exploiting them as a robustness check.},

Here, to promote such a practice, we recommend seven concrete statistical procedures: (1) visualizing data; (2) quantifying inferential uncertainty; (3) assessing data preprocessing choices; (4) reporting multiple models; (5) involving multiple analysts; (6) interpreting results modestly; and (7) sharing data and code.

The intent is to provide incentives for producers to make design changes that reduce waste, such as improving product recyclability and reusability, reducing material usage, and downsizing products. This paper assesses whether the range of policies that fall under the EPR umbrella can spur this ``design for environment'' (DfE). It summarizes the economics literature on the issue and describes conceptually how policies should affect design. It then analyzes three case studies in detail and two more case studies more briefly. The conclusion reached is that some DfE\textemdash especially reductions in material use and product downsizing\textemdash can be achieved with most EPR policies, including producer take-back mandates and combined fee/subsidy approaches. However, none of these alternative policies as they are currently implemented are likely to have a large impact on other aspects of DfE.},

  abstract = {Recycling and reusing recyclables is an important way to solve the municipal solid waste (MSW) problem. As the collection of solid waste takes up the largest percentage of MSW management budgets, improving the collection of recyclables is important. Since the decline of government-run waste buying depots in the late 1980s, the collection of recyclables from households and waste deposit sites in China is done by buyers with small informal bases and waste pickers, who are usually unskilled rural people who have come to the cities. Because of this, the current system is seen to have social problems. So, the recyclable collection system has both social as well as economic significance. China is in the process of rapid industrialization and urbanization, and a new mode of community collection system is emerging. It operates by market mechanisms, with waste collection companies that are supported by the municipal government, establishing recycle service sites, and employing workers to buy recyclables door-to-door. This paper is a case study of the new system in the Haidian District, Beijing. It summarizes the system, compares it to experiences in other countries and discusses whether the new approach contributes to resources recycling in China.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Brown carbon (BrC), a certain group of organic carbon (OC) with strong absorption from the visible (VIS) to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, makes a considerable contribution to light absorption on both global and regional scales. A high concentration and proportion of OC has been reported in China, but studies of BrC absorption based on long-term observations are rather limited in this region. In this study, we reported 3-year results of light absorption of BrC based on continuous measurement at the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System (SORPES) in the Yangtze River Delta, China, combined with Mie theory calculation. Light absorption of BrC was obtained using an improved absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent (AAE) segregation method. The AAE of non-absorbing coated black carbon (BC) at each time step is calculated based on Mie theory simulation, together with single particle soot photometer (SP2) and aethalometer observations. By using this improved method, the variation of the AAE over time is taken into consideration, making it applicable for long-term analysis. The annual average light absorption coefficient of BrC (\emph{b}\textsubscript{abs\_BrC}) at 370\&thinsp;nm was 6.3\&thinsp;Mm\textsuperscript{-1} at the SORPES station. The contribution of BrC to total aerosol absorption (\emph{P}\textsubscript{BrC}) at 370\&thinsp;nm ranged from 10.4 to 23.9\&thinsp;\% (10th and 90th percentiles, respectively), and reached up to {$\sim$}\&thinsp;33\&thinsp;\% in the open-biomass-burning-dominant season and winter. Both \emph{b}\textsubscript{abs\_BrC} and \emph{P}\textsubscript{BrC} exhibited clear seasonal cycles with two peaks in later spring/early summer (May\textendash June, \emph{b}\textsubscript{abs\_BrC} {$\sim$}\&thinsp;6\&thinsp;Mm\textsuperscript{-1}, \emph{P}\textsubscript{BrC} {$\sim$}\&thinsp;17\&thinsp;\%) and winter (December, \emph{b}\textsubscript{abs\_BrC} {$\sim$}\&thinsp;15\&thinsp;Mm\textsuperscript{-1}, \emph{P}\textsubscript{BrC} {$\sim$}\&thinsp;22\&thinsp;\%), respectively. Lagrangian modeling and the chemical signature observed at the site suggested that open biomass burning and residential coal/biofuel burning were the dominant sources influencing BrC in the two seasons, respectively.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Molecular markers in ambient organic aerosol (OA) provide highly specific source information. Their traditional quantification is based on offline analysis of filter samples, and the coarse time resolution and labor-intensive nature hugely limit the utility of the tracer data. In this study, hourly organic molecular markers in fine particulate matter were measured using a recently commercialized thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (TAG) technique at an urban location in Shanghai, China during a three-week campaign from 9 November to 3 December, 2018. Selected primary OA molecular markers, including anhydrosugars, fatty acids, aromatic acids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were examined in detail. Their diurnal variations showed characteristic features representing the corresponding emission source activities. For example, stearic acid showed a clear peak around 7 pm, in accordance with the enhanced cooking activities during mealtime. Diagnostic ratios of related makers of different reactivities provided unique information in uncovering the source information and tracking evolution of the OA in the atmosphere, for example, ratios of levoglucosan to its isomers and K+ identified crop residue burning as the major form of biomass burning (BB). Ratios of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids gave unambiguous indication of atmospheric degradation of unsaturated fatty acids after emissions. Oleic acid to stearic acid ratios in ambient data (0.83 {$\pm$} 0.54) were lower than those in the source profiles (1.2-6.5). Furthermore, the oleic acid to stearic acid ratio was found to be highly correlated with O/C ratios (Rp: -0.66), suggesting the possible utility of oleic acid as a model compound to examine the heterogeneous reaction of cooking-related OA. PAH ratio-ratio plots helped identify varying influences of major combustion sources associated with air masses of different origins, revealing that BB and coal combustion were dominant under the influence of long-range transport air mass, while vehicle emissions were dominant under local/median-range air mass influence. This study demonstrated the utility of high time-resolution organic markers in capturing the dynamic change of source emissions and atmospheric aging, providing observational evidence to support their use in source apportionment.},

  abstract = {Globalization policies are encouraging manufacturing companies to produce environment-friendly products that offer a sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, product recovery and zero-waste supply chains have caught the attention of manufacturers and professionals. Reverse logistics (RL) is considered as the most significant part of supply chain management in developed countries; unfortunately, its implementation in developing countries is in the initial stages due to certain barriers. This study aims to identify and verify the barriers to implementation of reverse logistics using a two-stage methodology: the Delphi Method and Structural Equation Modeling. A comprehensive literature review was considered to identify a primary set of barriers. Using the Delphi Method, a team of experts screened out barriers after performing three iterations. A survey-based questionnaire was then sent out to supply chain and logistics employees in the manufacturing industry and relevant government authorities. Five hundred and forty-seven useful responses were analyzed in the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) \& AMOS 21 softwares using Structural Equation Modeling to verify barriers, and ranked according to their severity. The most critical barriers with respect to each category are: high cost of reverse logistics adoption (finance and economics), lack of skilled professionals (knowledge and experience), lack of government supportive policies (law and regulation), poor organizational culture (management), lack of human resources (infrastructure and technology), lack of environmental law awareness (environment), lack of community pressure (market) and company policies (reverse logistics in policy). Overall, the top five barriers found in this study include lack of initial capital, lack of skilled professional in RL, companies' policies against RL, lack of new technologies and information systems, and lack of community pressure. Knowledge about barriers to reverse logistics allows manufacturing companies to prepare a priority list of actions for better implementation of the reverse logistics system.},

For example, a speaker can give credit to others as well as himself/herself. But while a speaker can offend others, it is less clear that a speaker can offend himself/herself. Understanding why this should be so provides us with a key insight into the nature of insults, namely, that it is predicated on the presumption that some dissimilarity exists between the speaker and the target of the insult. Various interesting implications follow from this insight, allowing us to (i) understand why competitive ritualized exchanges of insults are more commonly attested than are analogous competitions involving compliments; (ii) better appreciate the ideological bases of politically correct speech; and (iii) adjudicate on the relative merits of various theories of politeness, in particular, on claims concerning the relationship between politeness and face.},

Current research focuses predominantly on aquatic systems, whereas comparatively little is known regarding the sources, pathways, and possible accumulation of plastic particles in terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated the potential of organic fertilizers from biowaste fermentation and composting as an entry path for microplastic particles into the environment. Particles were classified by size and identified by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. All fertilizer samples from plants converting biowaste contained plastic particles, but amounts differed significantly with substrate pretreatment, plant, and waste (for example, household versus commerce) type. In contrast, digestates from agricultural energy crop digesters tested for comparison contained only isolated particles, if any. Among the most abundant synthetic polymers observed were those used for common consumer products. Our results indicate that depending on pretreatment, organic fertilizers from biowaste fermentation and composting, as applied in agriculture and gardening worldwide, are a neglected source of microplastic in the environment.},

  abstract = {Six hundred conventional recycled HDPE flake samples, which were recollected and sorted in the UK, were screened for post-consumer contamination levels. Each analysed sample consisted of 40-50 individual flakes so that the amount of analysed individual containers was in the range 24 000-30 000 post-consumer milk bottles. Predominant contaminants in hot-washed flake samples were unsaturated oligomers, which can be also be found in virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pellet samples used for milk bottle production. In addition, the flavour compound limonene, the degradation product of antioxidant additives di-tert-butylphenol and low amounts of saturated oligomers were found in higher concentrations in the post-consumer samples in comparison with virgin HDPE. However, the overall concentrations in post-consumer recycled samples were similar to or lower than concentration ranges in comparison with virgin HDPE. Contamination with other HDPE untypical compounds was rare and was in most cases related to non-milk bottles, which are {$<$}2.1\% of the input material of the recycling process. The maximum concentration found in one sample of 1 g was estimated as 130 mg kg-1, which corresponds to a contamination of 5200-6500 mg kg-1 in the individual bottle. The recycling process investigated was based on an efficient sorting process, a hot-washing of the ground bottles, and a further deep-cleaning of the flakes with high temperatures and vacuum. Based on the fact that the contamination levels of post-consumer flake samples are similar to virgin HDPE and on the high cleaning efficiency of the super-clean recycling process especially for highly volatile compounds, the recycling process investigated is suitable for recycled post-consumer HDPE bottles for direct food-contact applications. However, handpicking after automatically sorting is recommended to decrease the amount of non-milk bottles. The conclusions for suitability are valid, provided that the migration testing of recyclate contains milk bottles up to 100\% and that both shelf-life testing and sensorial testing of the products are successful, which are topics of further investigations.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become the most favourable packaging material world-wide for beverages. The reason for this development is the excellent material properties of the PET material, especially its unbreakability and the very low weight of the bottles compared to glass bottles of the same filling volume. Nowadays, PET bottles are used for softdrinks, mineral water, energy drinks, ice teas as well as for more sensitive beverages like beer, wine and juices. For a long time, however, a bottle-to-bottle recycling of post-consumer PET packaging materials was not possible, because of the lack of knowledge about contamination of packaging polymers during first use or recollection. In addition, the decontamination efficiencies of recycling processes were in most cases unknown. During the last 20 years, PET recollection as well as recycling processes made a huge progress. Today, sophisticated decontamination processes, so-called super-clean recycling processes, are available for PET, which are able to decontaminate post-consumer contaminants to concentration levels of virgin PET materials. In the 1991, the first food contact approval of post-consumer PET in direct food contact applications has been given for post-consumer recycled PET in the USA. Now, 20 years after the first food approval of a PET super-clean recycling process, this article gives an overview over the world-wide progress of the bottle-to-bottle recycling of PET beverage bottles, e.g. the recollection amount of post-consumer PET bottles and the super-clean recycling technologies.},

Over the past 200 years these compounds have been almost exclusively generated by human activity and have left a string of disasters in the wake of their accidental release. Most recently, the contamination of the Irish pork supply with dioxins resulted in an international recall of all Irish pork products. Epidemiologic data on human and ecological dioxin exposures have revealed a common pattern of biological response among vertebrate species, which is mediated through activation of the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). These AhR-mediated effects include profound consequences on the vertebrate individual exposed in early-life, with respect to myriad developmental endpoints including neurologic, immunologic, and reproductive parameters. Humans appear to be susceptible to these effects, in a manner similar to that of the laboratory and wildlife species which have demonstrated such outcomes. Furthermore, epidemiologic data suggest that there is little or no margin of exposure for humans, with respect to these developmental effects. Given these concerns, prudent public health policy should include the continued reduction of exposures.},

This new approach holds that investment in the water and sanitation sector should be demand driven, i.e., that households should be provided with services they want and for which they are willing to pay. This paper shows how results from a rapid appraisal of household demand for improved water services were used to identify the appropriate water service level in Lugazi, Uganda. The authors argue that a demand-driven planning process requires flexibility on the part of engineering consultants, planners, and government officials to respond to the kind of unexpected findings that are likely to emerge from serious dialogue with project beneficiaries. Engineering consultants, government planners, and donors must be willing to tackle water supply problems with an open mind and to create different water scenarios for a community as a function of the communitys own desires. At present, however, reference for most water supply planning jobs provide no incentive for this kind of creative problem solving. On the contrary, terms of reference typically penalize engineering and planning firms for using an adaptive, demand-driven approach. One pressing challenge is for water sector professionals, working for both donors and national governments, to craft terms of reference for water supply projects that reward practitioners for taking a demand-driven planning process seriously.},

  abstract = {The open burning of waste, whether at individual residences, businesses, or dump sites, is a large source of air pollutants. These emissions, however, are not included in many current emission inventories used for chemistry and climate modeling applications. This paper presents the first comprehensive and consistent estimates of the global emissions of greenhouse gases, particulate matter, reactive trace gases, and toxic compounds from open waste burning. Global emissions of CO2 from open waste burning are relatively small compared to total anthropogenic CO2; however, regional CO2 emissions, particularly in many developing countries in Asia and Africa, are substantial. Further, emissions of reactive trace gases and particulate matter from open waste burning are more significant on regional scales. For example, the emissions of PM10 from open domestic waste burning in China is equivalent to 22\% of China's total reported anthropogenic PM10 emissions. The results of the emissions model presented here suggest that emissions of many air pollutants are significantly underestimated in current inventories because open waste burning is not included, consistent with studies that compare model results with available observations.},

With the focus of the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, and of waste strategies on improving recycling rates, one of the major challenges in solid waste management in developing countries is how best to work with this informal sector to improve their livelihoods, working conditions and efficiency in recycling. The general characteristics of informal recycling are reviewed, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Despite the health and social problems associated with informal recycling, it provides significant economic benefits that need to be retained. Experience shows that it can be highly counterproductive to establish new formal waste recycling systems without taking into account informal systems that already exist. The preferred option is to integrate the informal sector into waste management planning, building on their practices and experience, while working to improve efficiency and the living and working conditions of those involved. Issues associated with integrating informal recycling into the formal waste management sector are discussed.},

  abstract = {Many developing country cities aspire to modern waste management systems, which are associated with relatively high recycling rates of clean, source separated materials. Most already have informal sector recycling systems, which are driven solely by the revenues derived from selling recovered materials, even though they are saving the formal sector money by reducing waste quantities. There is clear potential for `win-win' co-operation between the formal and informal sectors, as providing support to the informal sector, to build recycling rates and to address some of the social issues could reduce the overall costs of waste management for the formal sector. This paper shows that recycling rates already achieved by the informal sector can be quite high, typically in the range from 20\% to 50\%; often up to half of this is in the form of clean, source separated materials collected directly from households and businesses by itinerant waste buyers. Four country case studies provide a number of lessons on how this solid foundation could be used to build high recycling rates of clean materials.}

This concept explains that impoverished city residents construct pathways through the urban landscape that provide shelter, access to food, spaces of safety, and community. Informal recyclers' geographies of survival are connected with urban inequality and are exacerbated by neoliberal trends in the governance of Vancouver's physical, social, and political spaces. We observe that certain users and uses of public space are defined as disorderly or illegitimate, the poor are pushed to the margins of society, and rhetorical urban revitalization and ``greening'' agendas are prioritized over the needs of the poor in policy making. However, neoliberal trends are inherently contradictory and can change based on local contestation and opposition. Geographies of survival are therefore an important mechanism through which informal recyclers can reclaim city spaces as they resist spatial restrictions and work to maintain their access to necessary resources. We conclude that the geographies of survival lens provides an important perspective on urban power relationships and their spatial dynamics in contemporary Vancouver.},

  abstract = {This dissertation uses a feminist mixed-methods approach to investigate solid waste management and informal recycling practices in the city of Ahmedabad, India. The aim of this research is to understand the ways that power unevenly manifests in the urban everyday by exploring marginalized women waste pickers' experiences of wellbeing, work, and organizing through a moment of change in the governance of waste in urban India. This dissertation argues that contemporary solid waste management planning and discourses of urban cleanliness and inclusion in urban India are implicated in the continual reproduction of spatial, symbolic, political-economic, and social-cultural marginalization of women waste pickers. Key findings of the dissertation highlight women waste pickers' relational perceptions of wellbeing and work, the gendered impacts of contemporary waste governance for marginalized women workers, and women's experiences in organizing and navigating mechanisms of inclusion and municipal privatization. These findings point to the spatial, symbolic, material, and intersectional implications that contemporary waste governance and discourses of cleanliness and urban inclusion have in women waste pickers' everyday lives. The study draws on a survey (n=401), semi-structured interviews (n=45), follow-up interviews (n=36) and group workshop discussions (n=12) with women waste pickers in Ahmedabad between 2016-2018. It also relies on insights from local advocacy workers, NGO employees, and union representatives (n=11) and a discourse analysis of local media and policy documents. The dissertation is grounded in women waste pickers' perspectives, experiences, and knowledges as important yet under-valued observers and co-producers of urban space. From this perspective, this research makes important contributions toward theorizing marginalized informal work by emphasizing women's intersectional perspectives on the benefits and challenges of this work in a moment of change in the city. The research highlights the dynamics of power and oppression which tend to be obscured and the marginalized people who tend to be invisibilised in the production of clean-and-modern revitalized urban spaces. The research advances scholarship on vulnerable people in urban spaces and the exclusionary impacts of contemporary urban governance. The insights garnered from women waste pickers livelihoods and wellbeing may also contribute to advocacy and organizing work by scholars and activists and policy through this moment of change in India's urban governance.},

Waste pickers are self-employed urban workers who collect and sell recyclable materials on an informal basis and experience an array of hazards, risks, stigmas, and exclusions in their everyday lives and livelihoods. The paper uses a fluid and multidimensional approach in understanding marginalized women workers' wellbeing as relational, intersectional, and situated. The paper grounds its conceptualization of wellbeing in respondents' occupational narratives and highlights the need for the hazardous conditions of this precarious livelihood to be understood in terms of women's own relational priorities and intersectional identities. This study is based on a survey (n~=~401), semi-structured interviews (n~=~45), follow-up visits (n~=~36), and a series of group workshops (n~=~12) with women waste pickers in Ahmedabad between 2016 and 2018. I engage a grounded and feminist approach, privileging women's lived experiences as central in conceptualizing and addressing wellbeing in research and practice. Research findings engage with the overlapping and multiple dimensions comprising respondents' everyday livelihood experiences, priorities of a `good life,' and experiences of physical, mental, social, and spiritual wellbeing. The paper argues that by focusing on women waste pickers' relational perceptions and priorities of wellbeing, we can understand waste picking work as an important asset for women in navigating everyday life and precarity in the urban margins. The study thus foregrounds women waste pickers' understandings of the benefits and importance of this livelihood and discusses implications of these findings in the context of broader structural oppressions, constraints, and changes to urban governance that inform respondents' everyday exclusions in various urban spaces and contexts.},

  doi = {10.5539/jsd.v8n8p251},
  abstract = {Deforestation, habitat loss and forest degradation are the most critical issues facing Malawi today driven by higher population growth. Deforestation in water catchments has a direct link to the blackouts of the state-owned power producing company (Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi, ESCOM) and to the inadequate water supply by the semi-public Water Boards, both in dry and wet seasons due to sedimentation and low flows in the rivers. As a result, water and power utilities, private sector and communities are all severely affected by the impacts of deforestation. To solve deforestation in Malawi, the country requires a multi-sectoral integrated approach through creation of smart partnerships between public, semi-public and private sectors to support community-based afforestation and forest regeneration programmes. It is proposed that Malawi Reforestation and Environmental Protection Authority (MAREPA) be established through an Act of Parliament to collect funds and finance afforestation and forest regeneration activities. A small non-prohibitive tax (administrative levy) on selected key products, such as water, beer, electricity, sugar, tea, coffee, and tobacco, could be introduced to finance the MAREPA fund. This will be achieved through Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES), where a smart partnership among government, semi-public water and power utilities, private sector, development partners, and civil society would be paying for services rendered through conservation of forest resources which in turn reduces sedimentation in key water catchments. The ecosystem services could include carbon sequestration, water protection for consumption and hydroelectric power generation, biodiversity conservation, and natural landscape preservation. The proposed MAREPA can provide a way to finance sustainably afforestation and forest regeneration programmes instead of various stakeholders independently tackling deforestation in Malawi without coordination. A multi-sectorial taskforce could be formed to carefully review the feasibility of MAREPA and set a regulatory framework and a tax regime to cover annual funding needs for Malawi's afforestation and forest regeneration aims.},

  abstract = {Purpose Marine litter, mostly plastics, is a growing environmental problem. Environmental decision makers are beginning to take actions and implement regulations that aim to reduce plastic use and waste mismanagement. Nevertheless, life cycle assessment (LCA), a tool commonly used to assist environmental decision making, does not yet allow for considering the consequences of plastic waste leaked into the environment. This limits the application of LCA as a tool for highlighting potential tradeoffs between impact categories and the relative significance of their contribution on a specific Areas of Protection (AoP). A coordinated research effort to cover various parts of the marine litter impact pathway is required to ultimately produce characterisation factors that can cover this research gap. Here, we design a consistent and comprehensive framework for modelling plastic litter impact pathways in LCIA models. This framework is to support such coordinated research progress towards the development of harmonized pathways to account for impacts of plastic litter, specifically to the marine environment. The framework includes an overview of life cycle inventory requirements (leakage to the environment; a focus of other research efforts), and a detailed description of possible marine litter impact pathways, modelling approaches and data(-type) requirements. We focus on marine plastic litter and consider the potential contribution of different impact pathways to overall damage in the main operational AoPs, as well as recently proposed ones. Results and conclusions The proposed framework links inventory data in terms of kg plastic leaked to a specified environmental compartment (air, terrestrial, freshwater, marine) to six AoPs: ecosystem quality, human health, socio-economic assets, ecosystem services, natural heritage and cultural heritage. The fate modelling step, which includes transportation, fragmentation and degradation processes, is common to all included impact pathways. Exposure and effect modelling steps differentiate between at least six exposure pathways, e.g. inhalation, ingestion, entanglement, invasive species rafting, accumulation, and smothering, that potentially compromise sensitive receptors, such as ecosystems, humans, and manmade structures. The framework includes both existing, e.g. human toxicity and ecotoxicity, and proposed new impact categories, e.g. physical effect on biota, and can be used as a basis for coordinating harmonized research efforts.},

These `external validity' concerns are especially pressing for `complex' development interventions, in which the explicit purpose is often to adapt projects to local contextual realities and where high quality implementation is paramount to success. A basic analytical framework is provided for assessing the external validity of complex development interventions. It argues for deploying case studies to better identify the conditions under which diverse outcomes are observed, focusing in particular on the salience of contextual idiosyncrasies, implementation capabilities and trajectories of change. Upholding the canonical methodological principle that questions should guide methods, not vice versa, is required if a truly rigorous basis for generalizing claims about likely impact across time, groups, contexts and scales of operation is to be discerned for different kinds of development interventions.},

Analyses presented in this report are particularly timely as Malawi is planning for the coming half decade through the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) III (2016-2020). Malawi is urbanizing at a moderate rate and has a good chance of proactively managing the urbanization process. Opportunities may arise from a positive structural change that Malawi's economy is undergoing, whereby the driver of growth and job creation moves from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors. Faster urbanization, with strong linkages with rural areas, can contribute further to deepening such structural change. To unlock the potential of urbanization as a catalyst for long-term economic development, it is necessary to strengthen the capacity of urban local governments to generate revenues and meet the key infrastructure and service needs in urban areas, which remain challenging even at the current rate of urbanization.},

Probit and Tobit modelling were used to analyse the effect of farm and farmer characteristics and farmer attitudes on participation. The optimal bid offer was derived from a referendum contingent valuation (CV) survey for a proposed field margin programme. The results indicate that actual and contingent participation are better explained by the production environment and by familiarity with conservation programmes than by farmer characteristics or field characteristics. Contingent participation was significantly affected by farmers' perceptions of weed risks. The CV experiment suggested that up to 60 per cent participation might be achieved with appropriate bid offers.},

Although microplastics and human health is an emerging field, complementary existing fields indicate potential particle, chemical and microbial hazards. If inhaled or ingested, microplastics may accumulate and exert localized particle toxicity by inducing or enhancing an immune response. Chemical toxicity could occur due to the localized leaching of component monomers, endogenous additives, and adsorbed environmental pollutants. Chronic exposure is anticipated to be of greater concern due to the accumulative effect that could occur. This is expected to be dose-dependent, and a robust evidence-base of exposure levels is currently lacking. Although there is potential for microplastics to impact human health, assessing current exposure levels and burdens is key. This information will guide future research into the potential mechanisms of toxicity and hence therein possible health effects.},

  abstract = {The essay examines the meanings of waste in the community formation of waste pickers in today's Chinese megacities. We show that waste pickers in China echo to a certain extent the precarious and stigmatised labour conditions among those in the global south. But we have found that in China, financial reasons alone were not what pushed migrants to enter the trade. In fact, we have found that waste pickers in Beijing enter the waste business also to experiment with urban citizenship, freedom from the factory regime, entrepreneurship, and household making on the fringe of the nation's capital. Their strategies of working with waste offer a prism for understanding the wider dimension of social and cultural life in the waste community in a major city of China - what we refer to as ``living with waste.'' ``Living with waste'' in this paper is intended as a framework to encompass the everyday effort to work with, experience, and live with waste matter on a daily basis. How do waste pickers talk about their job? Is it just about stigmatisation and suffering? Can it be about business and mobility? How do they feel about raising kids in a waste-collecting courtyard? If dirt is ``matter of out of place'' (Douglas 1966), how do they deal with impurity and contamination on a daily basis? What kind of efforts do they make to normalise or create boundaries in the undesirable working and living environment? Living with waste, then, is deeply bound with efforts not only to make a livelihood, but also to constantly negotiate one's position with and draw boundaries from waste within the family and the community, in order to make the job bearable, and even meaningful.},

The mean BC mass concentration was observed to be 2200\,{$\pm$}\,1309\,ng/m3 at the sampling site during the entire observation period, with the highest (lowest) concentrations found in the winter (summer and spring). A distinct diurnal variations in BC revealed with two maximum peaks occurred between 06:00 and 09:00 local time (LT) and 19:00 and 22:00 LT in all four seasons, was correlated with source emissions, meteorology, and dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer. A significant seasonality was observed in the absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent ({$\alpha$}) with higher in spring and winter seasons, and lower during the summer. Further, it is evident that the contribution of BCff (BCff\%) dominated during the observation period with the mean contributions of BCff \% and BCbb\% to the BC were found to be \textasciitilde 81\% and 19\%, respectively. Similar to {$\alpha$}, BCbb\% also exhibited high fractions in spring and winter suggests an enhanced contribution from biomass burning sources, and a low in summer. The results from both the potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) models indicated that the air masses originating from the northern Zhejiang and Anhui provinces were the potential source areas responsible for the high BC concentrations attributed from agricultural waste burning in Nanjing.},

Through the questionnaires, the willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) of the residents in Liao River Basin were analyzed. Then based on analysis of the existing ecological compensation standard measuring methods, the WTP and WTA using contingent valuation method (CVM) were measured and analyzed. Without considering other factors, and based on using the nonparametric estimation method, it was concluded the ecological compensation standard of Liao River Basin was 160.72 yuan / person'years. When considering other factors, using the parametric estimation we obtain that the ecological compensation standard of Liao River Basin was 255.97 yuan/person'years. Measuring the respondents'WTP and WTA at the same time and processing the average can actually reflect the respondents'real WTP, thus to a certain extent solving the problems of high compensation caused by formulating ecological compensation standards according to measuring WTP of respondents separately. In addition, the policy suggestions have been proposed from three aspects including financial transfer payment, ecological compensation forms and public participation system. This will not only protect residents'right to know and strengthen public participation and supervision, but also benefit the comprehensive implementation of ecological environment of Liao River Basin and establishment of a long-term mechanism of water resources protection.},

  abstract = {Background: In Vietnam, efforts are underway to improve latrine use in rural and remote areas with particular focus on increasing coverage of sanitation in schools. However, there is a lack of information on how the school program affects latrine use by schoolchildren and at community level. This paper analyzes sanitation use among schoolchildren in a multi-ethnic area to inform future school-based sanitation promotion programmes. Methods: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was applied during a 5 months period in six primary and secondary schools and in the homes of schoolchildren in four different ethnic villages in Northern rural Vietnam. Using a structured questionnaire, 319 children were interviewed face-to-face to collect quantitative data. Qualitative methods included extensive observations at schools and in the homes of 20 children, a single day's diary writings of 234 children, in-depth interviews with children (20), their parents (20) and school staff (10), and focus group discussions with parents (4) and teachers (6), and picture drawing with children (12). Results: All surveyed schools had student latrines. However, the observed schoolchildren most commonly urinated and defecated in the open. Main barriers for latrine use included inadequate number of latrines, limited accessibility to latrines, lack of constant water supply in latrines and lack of latrine maintenance by school management. Programs promoting latrine use for children were not conducted in either schools or communities and were not established as a preferred social norm in such settings. Children perceived existing school latrines as unappealing and expressed a wish to have basic, functional, clean, and colorful school latrines with privacy. Conclusions: The paper shows that the current school based sanitation promotion is insufficient to change sanitation behavior of school children irrespective of their ethnicity. It is important that schools, households and communities work more closely together to increase use and uptake of latrine use among schoolchildren. Also, the contractors of latrine facilities must work more closely with local school management when constructing latrines, including identifying location, design and appropriate systems of water supply. A separate budget needs to be allocated to allow the school to maintain the sanitation infrastructure and keep it hygienic and appealing for users.},

The extent to which environmental rights may be applicable to these workers is measured by first reviewing the current conditions under which waste pickers in Durban work. The study then argues that, in accordance with section 24(a), all human beings have a fundamental right to an environment that is safe and does not threaten their health or well-being. It concludes that waste pickers ought to enjoy protection in their work environment. The research further highlights deficiencies in waste pickers' entitlement to have their work environment protected through legislative and other measures as provided for by section 24(b), by reviewing the extent in which current legislation and other measures provide for workplace protection for informal workers; who are the working poor. Finally, it gives recommendations on how these deficiencies could be addressed drawing lessons from foreign case law and international experiences which can be adapted to the South African context.},

Focusing on the transfer of policies and experiences (particularly conjoined demand management-free basic water programs and related social contestation), we provide examples of how neoliberal logics and human right to water principles intersect in evolving hybrid regulatory landscapes, which are characterized by contradiction. The human right to water makes a difference by influencing the drafting and implementation of water-related policies that affect to the lives of poor and vulnerable populations. Yet this process unfolds unevenly, as human right to water principles and practices are contextually applied, often alongside neoliberalizing policy instruments within evolving regulatory landscapes. Our analysis reveals the uneven effects of policy experimentation, transfer, and adaptation. The analysis shows that the principle of the human right to water affects the transformation of policy options circulating in the water sector, but it does so in relation to the institutional histories and policy options associated with uneven patterns of variegated neoliberalization in the water sector.},

If composting is going to become more widely implemented, it must be profitable and ideally, competitive with chemical nutrients, however the time and cost associated with plastics removal is currently a bottleneck to profitability. In this study we investigated the financial sustainability of compost production using a Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing method over 16-weeks to identify the types and duration of each activity required. Combining these data with capital and operating costs, we then modeled the profitability of the facility to identify cost-bottlenecks and to determine scenarios that would lead to improved profitability. The results show that it took 1 h 50 min of labor to produce 165-L (0.065 m3) bag of compost. A total of 12.3\% of the active labor time was spent sorting out plastics from the organic waste before composting, during composting and from the finished product before packaging. Until similar work is published on the topic, these values cannot be evaluated as being either optimal or wasteful, but rather, serve as a baseline against which future interventions\textemdash e.g., source separation, especially at markets can be evaluated. Though based in Malawi, the documented and modeled costs can be converted and scaled by other entrepreneurs/agencies who are interested in estimating the financial feasibility of composting in their own context.},

Comparing the volumes of sludge emptied to the volumes of sludge buried, we highlight the fact that a) there is a suspiciously low volume of pit-derived faecal sludge being safely disposed; b) most safely discharged sludge is taken from the small proportion of septic tanks in the city, and not from pit latrines; and c) that the cost of safely discharging does not seem to correlate with the volumes delivered (despite an option to discharge for free). There is a large and growing amount of sludge buried beneath the city which will need to be safely emptied and treated in coming years. The city and the WWTPs must move quickly to ensure that the businesses and infrastructure are prepared for the future faecal sludge management challenges that lay ahead, especially if they are to achieve SDG 6 by 2030.},

These ``accidental sustainopreneurs'' earn a living while helping societies become more sustainable. Their work for both upstream manufacturers and downstream consumers serves as a stepping stone toward the introduction of cleaner production across waste value chains in developing countries. They have positive effects on multiple recycling sectors, and their transition to formal, integrated solid waste management is the objective of this study. Inductive qualitative research design is employed to examine how these entrepreneurial agents work in unpredicted ways to create value for society while being stigmatized by focusing specifically on the case of waste picker sustainopreneurs registered with the Water and Sanitation Services in Pakistan (WSSP). The findings of this study suggested that a whopping 99\% majority of such workers pretend as if none of their kind exist, possess dual identities, and are stigmatized due to refugee backgrounds. Using the social construction of stigma lens, their identities have been stigmatized amidst their burden of complementing the work of local MSWM authorities. In addition, the findings regarding unpredictable weather patterns, lack of assets, seasonal shocks, uncertain policies, rules of business, and the exploitative subletting of waster picker jurisdictions are reported. This study provides a more thorough understanding of their self-organized work context, an understanding of policies, and the higher survival skills and immunity levels of these workers, even in the absence of safety equipment and measures. This study demonstrates how self-organizing, low-tech, informal solutions can act as a foundation toward cleaner productions and environmental sustainability.},

Despite a range of efforts by local and international stakeholders to increase access to modern energy sources in the country, 89 per cent of Malawi׳s energy is still sourced from traditional biomass mainly fuel wood. Only 8 per cent of the population in Malawi have access to electricity but installed capacity of electricity generation is lower than demand. This leads to load shedding by the electricity supplier; consequently electricity supply in Malawi is unreliable and micro and macroeconomic activities are significantly affected. Solar, non-traditional biomass (crop residues and forest residues not burnt on three stone fireplaces, and biogas), hydro, wind and geothermal are potential energy resources that could enhance Malawi׳s energy security. However, unreliable financing mechanisms for large scale energy projects; shortage of trained human resource; lack of coordination among local institutions; unclear regulation enforcement; and sometimes political governance impede sustainable delivery of energy projects. The Malawi energy policy targets and drivers are also discussed in the paper. Based on the prevailing energy situation, a PESTLE analysis is provided in this paper outlining a novel thinking for addressing the political (P), economic (E), social (S), technological (T), legal (L), and environmental (E) challenges that constrain the development of renewable energy technologies in Malawi.},

  abstract = {Waste generated by daily human activities and left to accumulate in ubiquitous,  illegal, unregulated dumpsites close to dwellings, is a problem in informal  settlements. If not collected and appropriately disposed of, it poses risks to public and  environmental health. The quality of life and living conditions of those that already  suffer deprivation due to living in informal settlements are further compromised.  Waste services provided by local government are generally not adequate in informal  settlements. Many municipalities struggle to provide even the most basic services to  contain solid waste in these areas due to a lack of infrastructure and financial  resources.  This study sought to determine the efficacy of current solid waste management in  enhancing living conditions in informal settlements in eThekwini Municipality. The  functionalism theory, neoliberalism theory, and communicative planning theory  provided the theoretical background for the study and enabled an understanding of the  role of different stakeholders in the management of solid waste in informal  settlements. The study employed qualitative research methods, consisting of interviews and  participant observation. It established that inhabitants of informal settlements cannot  afford to pay for waste management services, nor are they willing to do so. The study  found that the main barrier to effective municipal solid waste management and  healthy living conditions in informal settlements is a lack of political will and  stakeholder accountability in the solid waste management process, as well as the  exclusion of these settlements from the provision of formal basic sanitary services.  Another key determining factor is prevailing attitudes to solid waste management. To  change this mind-set, community members need to be educated on the dangers that  inadequate waste management pose to human and environmental well-being.  Participation and strong partnerships between different interest groups have been  found to be part of the solution to this problem and should be encouraged for effective  solid waste management in informal settlements.},

It is based on a case study of an NGO project that supports Manos Unidas (Joined Hands), an informal waste picker cooperative in Managua, Nicaragua. Using horse carts, these waste pickers collect household solid waste from informal settlements where there was no previous regular, official waste collection. Unlike many development projects, which try to control people?s agency, the support examined here focused on the residents of illegal neighbourhoods and the waste pickers, who themselves became city constructors and co-producers of basic services such as household waste collection rather than service recipients of aid programmes or municipal governments. By slightly changing the actions of the actors already involved in informal waste handling in the informal settlements, the project succeeded in transforming an agent of pollution into the solution to several interconnected problems, namely illegal dumping by the cart-men and residents, the cart-men?s low and irregular incomes and the lack of household waste collection services.},

  abstract = {Informal settlements in the global South cities are often neglected by formal solid waste collection services. In the city of Managua, the municipality and international and local NGOs recently implemented several waste management projects to provide waste collection in informal settlements. These projects supported or created cooperatives or microenterprises of waste pickers collecting household solid waste in barrios inaccessible to modern waste trucks. The projects also created three waste transfer stations, on barrio fringes, where the collected waste could be disposed and transported by municipal truck to the municipal landfill. New institutionalism theory and the ``travel metaphor'' illuminate how the ``waste transfer station'' idea travelled to Managua from various international organizations. New urban infrastructure and waste management models introduced by donors were decoupled from existing waste management models and practices. Despite the organizational hypocrisy of the city administration, introducing this new model via pilot projects in three city districts challenges the logic of the existing centralized waste management system, which ignores the city's informal settlements. The introduced waste transfer stations and associated waste collection practices were translated, and sometimes contested, in some informal settlements through protests, occupations, and other defiance strategies enacted by municipal waste collectors, squatters, and residents.},

The analysis identified the socio-economic factors that affect the respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) for CRS. A survey using standardized questionnaires of the contingent valuation method (CVM) was administered to 460 households. The proposed scheme received a positive response with high willingness of residents to separate (90\%) but low WTP (34\%) for the scheme charges. Despite the average of WTP curbside recycling charges of MYR88.80 added to household annual tax has translated into MYR7.40 per month (USD 2.50), the study revealed various issues to improve existing recycling facilities with the solid waste management (SWM) and recycling practices. The analysis further revealed that CRS gained support from the Chinese who practice recycling and also from older age groups with the involvement of other family members such as a father/husband and adult and household who has the right attitude towards recycling. It showed the demand for more convenient recycling services which is an improvement from drop-off recycling facilities or a public recycling facilities to a private recycling services at the household level. Finally, CRS has potential application in the middle-high income residential areas of Bangsar and Wangsa Maju.},

Most of RSW are still discarded randomly without any treatment in China. Scattered RSW generation sources, imperfect legislation system, poor infrastructure on treatment and disposal are identified as the biggest challenge for RSW management currently in China. To improve RSW management, increasing financial resources, establishing sorting collection and transportation network, promoting sorting collection and recycling, improving treatment technology are proposed as the possible solution.},

Contingent valuation method (CVM) was employed to estimate respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) for RSW separation and management. Results indicated that some rural households had spontaneously separated the recyclable waste and food waste to some extent. The public were aware of the importance of RSW separation through various media. Further, more than half of households were willing to participate in the separation program. The dominant barriers of participation were the lack of awareness of separation, inconvenience and insufficient separation facility (53.7\%). In addition, 62.5\% of rural households had a positive WTP for RSW separation and management and the mean WTP was estimated to be 26.4CNY/year. Age, annual household income and location significantly influenced the respondents' WTP. Therefore, we suggest that policy makers implement the pilot programs of RSW separation at source accordingly and devote efforts to providing collection service and improving RSW management by combining government financial budget and rural households' payment.},

Relative odor activity values (ROAV) was applied to distinguish characteristic odors description of HDPE pellets in different manufacturers. Results showed that the established fingerprinting of VOCs based on HS-GC-IMS could provide an effective means for rapidly identifying rHDPE plastics. The more substantial amounts of VOCs in rHDPE flakes and pellets are terpenes and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Although the re-granulation process effectively removed most of the VOCs remaining in the washing process, acids, aromatic hydrocarbons, and terpenes were potentially residual in the rHDPE pellets. It was also revealed that terpenes and acids were the volatile odor compounds in most rHDPE pellets. Both d-limonene and octanal are the main key compounds of rHDPE pellets because of their maximum contribution to the overall odor, and together with other key odor compounds with similar odor, form the characteristic odor of citrus, sweet, and floral.},

Two separate questionnaires were issued, one questionnaire to PET bottle consumers and one to PET bottle recyclers. In this study, consumers are defined as people that consume PET-bottled beverages in their daily life. Recyclers were defined as those involved in the collection and recycling of PET bottles. These include scavengers, itinerant waste buyers, small community waste-buying depots, medium/large redemption depots, and recycling companies. In total, 580 surveys were completed, including 461 by consumers and 119 by recyclers. The authors found that consumption of PET bottles in Beijing was nearly 100,000 tonnes in 2012. Age, occupation, gender, and education were identified as significant factors linked to PET-bottled beverage consumption, while income was not a significant factor. 90\% Of post-consumed PET bottles were collected by informal collectors (i.e., scavengers and itinerant waste buyers). The survey also found that nearly all PET bottles were reprocessed by small factories that were not designed with pollution control equipment, which allows them to offer higher prices for waste recyclable bottles. As Beijing is trying to build a formal recycling collection system for recyclables, subsidies should be given to the formal recycling sector rather than being charged land use fees, and attention should also be given to informal recyclers that make their living from the collection of recyclables. Informal and formal sectors may work together by employing the scavengers and itinerant waste buyers for the formal sectors. In addition to the recycling of PET bottles, concern should also be allocated to reduce consumption, especially among young people, as they, compared to other groups, have a stronger demand for PET-bottled beverages and will be the main body of society.},

In some cases, however, the sample size is relatively small because of the limitation of survey cost or other factors. The allocation methods of sampling efforts among strata in stratified random surveys with small sample size may need adjustment compared with traditional approaches. In this study, two sampling stations were allocated to each stratum first and then the remaining sampling units were allocated among strata using five traditional allocation methods. In order to distinguish them from traditional methods, we called them adjusted methods in this study. A simulation study was conducted to compare the performances of different allocation strategies of sampling efforts in a stratified random survey for estimating abundance indices of multiple target species. Relative estimation error (REE) and relative bias (RB) were used to measure the precision and accuracy of estimates of abundance indices under different allocation schemes of sampling efforts in the multispecies survey. The performances of different allocation schemes in estimating abundance indices varied greatly for different species over different seasons. The adjusted Neyman allocation scheme could significantly reduce the REE and RB of estimates of abundance index for single species survey. For multiple species surveys, the adjusted average-Neyman allocation method, the adjusted Yate allocation method, the adjusted proportional allocation method and current allocation method had relatively high accuracy and precision of estimates of abundance indices for four species in terms of the totalREE and totalRB. Though the adjusted average-Neyman allocation scheme did not always have the best performance, it was the optimal one considering the accuracy and precision of estimates of abundance indices for all species simultaneously. The allocation of sampling efforts among strata in stratified random surveys targeting for estimating abundance indices of multiple species should comprehensively consider the variance of abundance of different species in stratum and the seasonal changes.},

As a consequence, the emissions of major air pollutants have decreased and the air quality has substantially improved. Here, we quantified China's anthropogenic emission trends from 2010 to 2017 and identified the major driving forces of these trends by using a combination of bottom-up emission inventory and index decomposition analysis (IDA) approaches. The relative change rates of China's anthropogenic emissions during 2010\textendash 2017 are estimated as follows: -62\&thinsp;\% for SO\textsubscript{2}, -17\&thinsp;\% for NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}}, +11\&thinsp;\% for nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), +1\&thinsp;\% for NH\textsubscript{3}, -27\&thinsp;\% for CO, -38\&thinsp;\% for PM\textsubscript{10}, -35\&thinsp;\% for PM\textsubscript{2.5}, -27\&thinsp;\% for BC, -35\&thinsp;\% for OC, and +16\&thinsp;\% for CO\textsubscript{2}. The IDA results suggest that emission control measures are the main drivers of this reduction, in which the pollution controls on power plants and industries are the most effective mitigation measures. The emission reduction rates markedly accelerated after the year 2013, confirming the effectiveness of China's Clean Air Action that was implemented since 2013. We estimated that during 2013\textendash 2017, China's anthropogenic emissions decreased by 59\&thinsp;\% for SO\textsubscript{2}, 21\&thinsp;\% for NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}}, 23\&thinsp;\% for CO, 36\&thinsp;\% for PM\textsubscript{10}, 33\&thinsp;\% for PM\textsubscript{2.5}, 28\&thinsp;\% for BC, and 32\&thinsp;\% for OC. NMVOC emissions increased and NH\textsubscript{3} emissions remained stable during 2010\textendash 2017, representing the absence of effective mitigation measures for NMVOCs and NH\textsubscript{3} in current policies. The relative contributions of different sectors to emissions have significantly changed after several years' implementation of clean air policies, indicating that it is paramount to introduce new policies to enable further emission reductions in the future.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In this paper, identification system of plastic solid waste (PSW) based on near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy in combination with Support Vector Machine (SVM) was presented. A device applied to obtain NIR spectra of plastics in the detection platform was developed. After pre-processing (normalized, 1st derivative and smooth), the repeatability of spectral absorption features was improved, which would assist the identification. A ``principal component analysis (PCA)SVM'' identification method was proposed to identify polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) among plastics, and its identification accuracy can reach 97.5\%. The type of samples could clearly be identified and the shape of samples could also be roughly discerned. It is clearly shown that this system can achieve good identification results while reducing costs considerably, which has great potential in industrial recycling.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to outline the socio-economic and environmental implications of the informal sector engaged in waste recycling in the city of Kanpur, with special emphasis on the lives of lowest group of people, i.e. waste-pickers, and to discuss various possible scenarios to integrate them with the formal sector. Design/methodology/approach The study involved field survey of secondary material markets, followed by the administration of questionnaires to 40 respondents belonging to various segments of the informal sector. The questionnaires were designed to elicit information on the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. The study was conducted in 2004. Findings The study has attempted to delve into the socio-economic conditions of the waste and dump-pickers, the lowest segment of the informal recycling sector. The study of the status of existing alliances of formal-informal sector and the community shows that there is a lot of scope for improvement in the management of solid waste and the condition of the informal waste-recycling sector. Stronger alliances have the potential to improve the services as well as the socio-economic condition of the informal waste-recycling sector. Research limitations/implications A very small sample size was selected for this study in the absence of any prior database pertaining to the size, socio-economic conditions of the informal waste-recycling sector. Originality/value The paper attempts to understand the important role played by the informal sector engaged in waste recycling. This work is original, as no such analysis has been carried out in the study area. This study could be further extended.}

However, plastic waste generated during such water quality testing programs, mostly through the use of pre-sterilized disposable materials, is non-negligible. The objective of this study was to evaluate several re-use protocols for disposable filter funnels used by the MICS water quality test kits. Decontamination and re-use protocols were assessed in centralized laboratory and decentralized field settings and neither yielded positive results. Re-use of 100 mL sterile funnels decontaminated with an alcohol wipe resulted in a higher incidence of false positive results (i.e., positive contamination when processing sterile water), both in the laboratory and field; therefore, a higher proportion of positives tests can be expected if these components are re-used. Further improvements to the decontamination technique and training are needed before material re-use can be reliably adopted. Autoclaving the funnels for re-use is feasible, provided that there is capacity to re-package and distribute funnels in a sterile manner.},

  abstract = {The problem of Energy demand in Malawi has to some extent affected the construction industry. Almost all burnt bricks in Malawi are produced on scove kilns and this is an inefficient process and consumes a lot of fuel wood. This demand has competed with the domestic demand with disastrous effects on the environment. This paper argues that while the construction industry has ready alternative, there is a remote chance to reduce the domestic wood fuel demand until government can exploit other sources of energy in the urban areas for domestic use. The demand for burnt brick has contributed to the deforestation of Malawi. It is further argued that government should ban the use of burnt bricks and there would be a rapid growth of other brick substitutes that require very little energy to produce. The paper has outlined the basic facts of energy conversion scenarios from all available energy sources in Malawi. Conversion of wood to heat has been singled out as the least efficient and therefore recommends that the use of fuel wood for burning bricks should be discontinued while the conversion into charcoal should be checked. Other substitutes for the burnt brick should be explored and the paper has given a number of examples that would contribute to the reduction of the current large demand on wood fuel.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Equivalent black carbon (EBC) measured by a multi-wavelength Aethalometer can be apportioned to traffic and wood burning. The method is based on the differences in the dependence of aerosol absorption on the wavelength of light used to investigate the sample, parameterized by the source-specific absorption \AA ngstr\"om exponent (\emph{{$\alpha$}}). While the spectral dependence (defined as \emph{{$\alpha$}} values) of the traffic-related EBC light absorption is low, wood smoke particles feature enhanced light absorption in the blue and near ultraviolet. Source apportionment results using this methodology are hence strongly dependent on the \emph{{$\alpha$}} values assumed for both types of emissions: traffic \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR}, and wood burning \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB}. Most studies use a single \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} and \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} pair in the Aethalometer model, derived from previous work. However, an accurate determination of the source specific \emph{{$\alpha$}} values is currently lacking and in some recent publications the applicability of the Aethalometer model was questioned.{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}Here we present an indirect methodology for the determination of \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} and \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} by comparing the source apportionment of EBC using the Aethalometer model with \textsuperscript{14}C measurements of the EC fraction on 16 to 40 h filter samples from several locations and campaigns across Switzerland during 2005\textendash 2012, mainly in winter. The data obtained at eight stations with different source characteristics also enabled the evaluation of the performance and the uncertainties of the Aethalometer model in different environments. The best combination of \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} and \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} (0.9 and 1.68, respectively) was obtained by fitting the Aethalometer model outputs (calculated with the absorption coefficients at 470 and 950 nm) against the fossil fraction of EC (EC\textsubscript{F} / EC) derived from \textsuperscript{14}C measurements. Aethalometer and \textsuperscript{14}C source apportionment results are well correlated (\emph{r} = 0.81) and the fitting residuals exhibit only a minor positive bias of 1.6 \% and an average precision of 9.3 \%. This indicates that the Aethalometer model reproduces reasonably well the \textsuperscript{14}C results for all stations investigated in this study using our best estimate of a single \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} and \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} pair. Combining the EC, \textsuperscript{14}C, and Aethalometer measurements further allowed assessing the dependence of the mass absorption cross section (MAC) of EBC on its source. Results indicate no significant difference in MAC at 880 nm between EBC originating from traffic or wood-burning emissions. Using EC\textsubscript{F} / EC as reference and constant a priori selected \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} values, \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} was also calculated for each individual data point. No clear station-to-station or season-to-season differences in \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} were observed, but \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} and \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} values are interdependent. For example, an increase in \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} by 0.1 results in a decrease in \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} by 0.1. The fitting residuals of different \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} and \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} combinations depend on EC\textsubscript{F} / EC such that a good agreement cannot be obtained over the entire EC\textsubscript{F} / EC range using other \emph{{$\alpha$}} pairs. Additional combinations of \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} = 0.8, and 1.0 and \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} = 1.8 and 1.6, respectively, are possible but only for EC\textsubscript{F} / EC between {$\sim$} 40 and 85 \%. Applying \emph{{$\alpha$}} values previously used in the literature such as \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} of {$\sim$} 2 or any \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} in combination with \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} = 1.1 to our data set results in large residuals. Therefore we recommend to use the best \emph{{$\alpha$}} combination as obtained here (\emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{TR} = 0.9 and \emph{{$\alpha$}}\textsubscript{WB} = 1.68) in future studies when no or only limited additional information like \textsuperscript{14}C measurements are available. However, these results were obtained for locations impacted by black carbon (BC) mainly from traffic consisting of a modern car fleet and residential wood combustion with well-constrained combustion efficiencies. For regions of the world with different combustion conditions, additional BC sources, or fuels used, further investigations are needed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
